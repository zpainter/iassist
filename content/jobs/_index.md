## Job Postings
The IASSIST Jobs Repository is a record of job
descriptions posted to the members' email list from 2005 to
the present, providing a communal resource for employers and
job-hunters. This blog post with comments from the
Accidental Data Librarian session at the 2005 IASSIST
conference may also be of interest.
