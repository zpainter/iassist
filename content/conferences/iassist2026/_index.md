-->

**Host institution:** IASSIST

### Conference info

In order to allow as many as possible to attend IASSIST 2026, the conference will be virtual. More information about the arrangements will be released in the fall of 2026.

We are building an engaging array of events and formats to maximize our shared time at the conference.  Besides presentations and panels, IASSIST 2026 will feature semi-structured time, with attendee-selected themes for discussion and idea exchange, as well as unstructured segments. Social hours, trivia and participatory games will round out the experience.

IASSIST (International Association for Social Science Information Services and Technology) is an international organization of professionals working with information technology and data services to support research and teaching. IASSIST members are working together to advocate for responsible data management and use, to build a broader community surrounding research data, and encourage the development of data professionals.

We greatly value the in-person camaraderie and networking that occurs in person and hope to return to an in-person conference in 2027. 

See you virtually! It will be the **Best IASSIST. Ever**.

IASSIST Administrative Committee with the full support of University of Massachusetts Amherst Libraries has voted to make the 2026 conference virtual. 

We thank University of Massachusetts Amherst Libraries for their willingness and hard work to host IASSIST 2026.  While many were looking forward to travelling to Amherst, we want to give you ample notice that the 2026 conference will be virtual. Since planning began, we have heard from many that you would be unable to attend an in-person conference in 2026 due to changes in funding and other challenges.  IASSIST strives to be inclusive and we know many long time members are never or rarely able to attend in person conferences.

While many details need to be worked out including time zone challenges, we will strive to continue our tradition of the "Best IASSIST Ever" conference with added inclusivity!
