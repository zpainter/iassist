## Frequently asked questions related to the Conference

Frequently asked questions related to the Conference are answered here.

### Where will the conference take place?

The conference will take place online, June 1-5, 2026.

It was originally planned to take place in Amherst, MA, USA, but it has become clear that many in the US and elsewhere would be unable to attend an in-person event in 2026 due to changes in funding and other challenges. Therefore, the IASSIST Adminstrative Committee has voted to make the 2026 conference virtual.
