### Land acknowledgment
 
Halifax, also called Kjipuktuk (ji-buk-tuk), is in the ancestral and unceded territory of the Mi’kmaq People. It is covered by the Treaties of Peace and Friendship, first signed in 1726, which established rules for an ongoing relationship between nations. The people of the Mi’kmaw Nation have lived on this territory for millennia, and we acknowledge them as the past, present, and future caretakers of this land.
