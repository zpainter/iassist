## Uncharted: Navigating the Future of Data

### Call for Proposals

IASSIST and the ACMLA would like to invite you to join us for the 49th Annual IASSIST conference and 57th annual Carto conference being jointly held in Halifax, Nova Scotia, from May 28-31, 2024 to talk about the future of data in libraries, archives, and data services. 

The motto of Halifax is "e mari merces", or "wealth from the sea"; this wealth was originally measured in fish, but today we could equally think of the wealth to be found in an ocean of data. Artificial intelligence, climate change, and a host of other influences are moving us into uncharted territory. This conference challenges you to chart new pathways and to think about using data to navigate our way to a better future together. 

The conference will be held in-person, centering networking opportunities and interaction. We welcome submissions for papers, presentations, posters, demos, workshops, and lightning talks that embrace our conference theme, ***Uncharted: Navigating the future of data***, by looking towards emerging trends and topics of particular relevance to data and geospatial professionals working within libraries, research and data services, and archives. Possible topics include (but are not limited to): 

- Geospatial and data services of the future
- Maps and data for social justice
- Environmental impact and sustainability
- Artificial Intelligence 
- Reproducibility
- Partnerships and collaboration
- Data and geospatial literacy
- Data management and archiving
- Data discovery, access, and metadata
- Data governance and ethics

### Call for Posters 

Do you have a new idea you would like feedback on? Would you like to showcase a new service, initiative, or resource? Consider submitting a poster! Posters are a great way to exchange ideas and get feedback. We will be holding a "Poster Reception" to encourage interaction and networking while engaging with these visually dynamic materials. 

### Call for Papers & Paper Competition 

We will also be holding a paper competition and the winner of the paper competition will be announced at the Business Meeting during the conference. To be considered completed papers will need to be submitted by April 15, 2024.
