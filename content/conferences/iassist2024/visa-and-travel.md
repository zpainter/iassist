### Basic information about visa requirements for travelling to Canada

The information below is intended as a starting point. Travellers should confirm current requirements and guidelines directly with the Canadian government, as conditions may change.

#### Arriving Halifax

We encourage flying direct to Halifax, Nova Scotia, from major cities in Europe, United States, and Canada. Direct flights to Halifax Stanfield International Airport (YHZ) are available from most Canadian cities, from major hub cities in the United States (multiple options), and Frankfurt and London (Heathrow) in Europe.

Canadian airlines that fly from other Canadian cities to Halifax:

All visitors entering Canada by air, land, and sea are required to carry a valid passport and in certain cases a visa. Transportation [via rail <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://www.viarail.ca/en) is not easily travelled throughout Canada, especially to the eastern coast of the country. Expect 24-48 hours drive by car or by train one way from major cities in eastern North America.  No buses are available cross-province. More information about [sea travel <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://www.novascotia.com/travel-info/getting-here/sea) to Nova Scotia is available.
