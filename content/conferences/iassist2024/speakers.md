<strong>Dr. Jackie Carter</strong><br /><br />

Jackie is Professor of Statistical Literacy at The University of Manchester, UK, and the Academic Lead for EDI Disability. She has received UK awards as a One in Twenty Women in Data and National Teaching Fellows. She writes and speaks internationally about the Data Fellows programme she has pioneered which creates opportunities for undergraduates, including those from disadvantaged backgrounds and underrepresented groups, to gain paid work placements in data and tech industries. Her current role as the Disability academic lead for the University of Manchester is opening up opportunities to ask questions about how inclusive Higher Education actually is, and whether we have access to the data we need to make informed decisions for our staff and students. 

In this fireside chat she will reflect how she â€˜becameâ€™ a disabled person in mid-career and provoke discussion about how data professions could be a wonderfully inclusive place if only we opened them even more to those with disabilities and ensure age is not a barrier.
