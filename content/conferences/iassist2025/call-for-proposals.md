## IASSIST at 50! Bridging oceans, harbouring data & anchoring the future

### Call for Proposals

IASSIST 2025 invites you to join us in Bristol, United Kingdom, for its golden anniversary conference (yes, that is 50 years!!) from **June 3 - June 6, 2025** to engage in the past, present, and future of data services, including data management and technologies. IASSIST (the International Association for Social Science Information Services and Technology) is an international organization of professionals working with information technology and data services to support research and teaching. 

Visit lively, yet laid-back, Bristol and find a city full of character, centuries-old heritage, and an irrepressible creative zeal. Enveloped in the hills of South West England, Bristol is a city full of unique experiences, from year-round festivals, award-winning cycle tracks, and gastronomy of every flavour, to first-class arts venues, and awe-inspiring street art.

The conference will be held in-person, centring around networking opportunities and interactions. We welcome submissions for papers, presentations, posters, demonstrations, workshops, and lightning talks that embrace our conference theme, **Bridging oceans, harbouring data & anchoring the future**. We are seeking out information on: the connections created by data and data services professionals and enthusiasts; the wealth of knowledge in the community; the context of our profession today; and good data practice in the future. Possible topics include (but are not limited to): 

- Environmental impact and sustainability
- Artificial Intelligence 
- Reproducibility
- Partnerships and collaboration
- Data literacy
- Data consultation and librarianship
- Data management and archiving
- Data provenance, CARE / FAIR data principles
- Data discovery and access
- Data documentation and metadata
- Data governance and ethics
- Data gaps and biases

Have you ever considered submitting a poster? Do you have a new idea you would like feedback on? Would you like to showcase a new service or resource? We will be holding a **Poster Reception** to encourage conversations, sharing of ideas, and community building, while engaging with these visually dynamic posters. 

**The deadline for submissions is Friday December 13, 2024.**

We request that submitters limit themselves to one proposal per format type.

Decisions regarding submissions will be sent out by email mid-February 2025.

## Support for Attending the Conference 

**IASSIST Fellows Program** supports data professionals from countries with emerging economies and underrepresented regions who are developing information infrastructures regarding the use and preservation of public and private data, implementing information policy decisions, and providing data services at their home institutions.

**IASSIST Early Professional Fellows Program** supports early career data professionals from under-resourced institutions. It recognizes the value of new and innovative ideas from graduates and professionals new to data in the social sciences, who may not otherwise have the funding to travel.

**Applications will close on Friday December 13, 2024.** Please address your questions about the Fellows Program to Fellows Committee Co-Chairs Florio Arguillas (foa2 at cornell.edu) and Sarah Young (sarahy at andrew.cmu.edu).

## Presentation Formats

The Program Committee welcomes proposals for the following formats:

**Workshops**
Successful workshop proposals will blend lecture and active learning techniques. Typically workshops are half-day with 2-hour and 3-hour options. Workshops will be held on May 28, 2024. 

**Individual Presentation** This format is a 15-minute talk. If your individual proposal is accepted, you will be grouped into an appropriate session with similar presentations.

**Paper** This format is a 15-minute talk. Presenters are required to submit an original research paper in advance of the conference and present and discuss its findings at the conference as an Individual Presentation. We will select submissions based on proposals, and the authors of accepted proposals are required to submit their final and complete papers by April 2023. All papers will be eligible for publication consideration in an edition of IASSIST Quarterly. In addition, one paper will be selected as best paper with a prize of one free registration for a future IASSIST conference.

**Posters or Demonstration** This format is most useful for one-on-one discussions about your research topic or tool demonstration. Proposals in this category should identify the message being conveyed in the poster or the demonstration.

**Lightning Talks** A lightning talk is a short, highly visual presentation. Presentations in this category are timed, and speakers are restricted to 5 minutes total. Presentations should have a maximum of 15 slides, but there is no restriction on how many minutes you stay on each slide or the exact format of the presentation as long as you stay within the strict time limit. These are not your typical conference presentations.

**Panel** You may propose an entire session (60 minutes) with a minimum of three speakers to "deep dive "into a specific resource or concept. The session proposal can take a variety of forms, e.g., a set of three to four presentations, a discussion panel, a tutorial (with less substance than a pre-conference workshop), a discussion with the audience, etc. If accepted, the person who proposed the session becomes the session organizer and is responsible for securing speakers and a chair. Please note: the names of all speakers and the moderator must be included in the proposal.

NOTE: When submitting you will be required to select one of the proposal formats above, but it is possible that your submission may be accepted on the condition of adapting it to another format (e.g., an individual presentation proposal might be accepted if you are willing to adapt it to a poster or a Lightning Talk). If this is the case, you will be given the choice to accept this format change or to decline being in the conference program when notified of its acceptance.
