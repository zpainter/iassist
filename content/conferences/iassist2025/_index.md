**IASSIST at 50! Bridging oceans, harbouring data & anchoring the future**

IASSIST 2025 would love for you to join us in Bristol, United Kingdom, for its golden anniversary conference from June 3 to June 6, 2025, to engage in the past, present, and future of data services, including data management and technologies. 

IASSIST (International Association for Social Science Information Services and Technology) is an international organization of professionals working with information technology and data services to support research and teaching. 

The Call for proposals will be coming out in early November. Stay tuned!
