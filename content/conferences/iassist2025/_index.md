## 50th Annual Conference of IASSIST

<!--### theme -->

### Bristol, UK, June 3-6, 2025

**Host institution:** University West of England

Workshops will be held on the [UWE campus <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://www.uwe.ac.uk/), and the conference sessions will be at the [Mercure Bristol Grand Hotel <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://all.accor.com/hotel/A0I2/index.en.shtml) in the historic city centre.

We look forward to meeting in England, UK next June for the first time since the 1975 IASSIST Organising Committee Meeting took place at the London School of Economics 50 years earlier in [1975](https://iassistdata.org/conferences/1974-1999-conferences). 

Further news about the program and local arrangements to come in due course, but it will be the **Best. IASSIST. Ever.**
