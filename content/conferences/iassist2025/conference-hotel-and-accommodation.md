## Conference Hotel

We encourage conference participants to book a room at the [Mercure Bristol Grand Hotel <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://all.accor.com/hotel/A0I2/index.en.shtml), where the conference will also be held.

**Important:** This preferential rate cannot be booked through a third-party agent. Rooms must be booked directly with the hotel using the contact details above.

### Reservations

To book a room at the conference venue at the preferential rate, follow these steps:

Contact the Reservation Office Directly:
: Email: Ha0i2-re@accor.com
: Phone: 0117 929 1645 

When speaking with the Reservations Team, let them know you are attending the conference and use the code **IASSIST2025**. This will ensure you receive the preferential rate of **Â£155.00 per room per night**, which includes breakfast and is inclusive of VAT.

The preferential rate is available for stays from the weekend before the conference to the weekend after, but you will need to book this at the same time as the conference days.
 
**Book Early.** We have limited rooms available as part of an allocation block. The allocation block has a 6-week release policy, meaning the rooms reserved for the conference must be booked at least six weeks before the conference. Any unbooked rooms will be released after this time.

**Confirmation and payment:** When booking with the conference venue they charge upon arrival and not in advance.

Room Requirements:
: Double Room: In the UK, hotel rooms listed as "double" typically mean the room contains one double-sized bed.
: Twin Room: If you are booking a room for double occupancy but do not wish to share a bed, you should request a twin room. A twin room typically has two single beds, not two double beds.

**Important:** These room types may differ from what is commonly expected in North American hotels, where double-occupancy rooms often have two separate double beds.
