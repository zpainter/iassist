## Conference Hotel

We encourage conference participants to book a room at the [Mercure Bristol Grand Hotel <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://all.accor.com/hotel/A0I2/index.en.shtml), where the conference will also be held.

**Please note:** We understand from the Mercure Bristol Grand hotel that all rooms allocated to IASSIST 2025 have now been booked and are no longer available – however, you may well still be able to book a room with them at a good rate, using searches such as booking dot com, tripadvisor, or premierinn dot com for hotels. 

Alternatively for self-catering accommodation, try sites such as airbnb.

Early booking is advised. We cannot recommend any one hotel over others, as delegates' needs will differ, but there should be a good choice of high quality reasonably priced accommodation to meet your requirements and ensure an enjoyable and comfortable stay in Bristol!

The preferential rate was **£155.00 per room per night**, which included breakfast and was inclusive of VAT, and was to be charged upon arrival and not in advance.

**Room Requirements:**

- Double Room: In the UK, hotel rooms listed as "double" typically mean the room contains one double-sized bed.
- Twin Room: If you are booking a room for double occupancy but do not wish to share a bed, you should request a twin room. A twin room typically has two single beds, not two double beds.
- **Important:** These room types may differ from what is commonly expected in North American hotels, where double-occupancy rooms often have two separate double beds.
