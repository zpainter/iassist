We welcome submissions for presentations, panels, papers, posters, workshops, and lightning talks. 

The theme of this year’s conference is 

#### Diversity in Research: Social Justice from Data

Submissions on all data topics from data professionals related to *data archiving, data management, data librarianship/stewardship, data literacy, and similar areas* are welcome and the following topics are encouraged: 

- Ableism
- Ageism
- Decolonization and postcolonialism
- Democratization and political participation
- Environmentalism and climate change
- Indigenous and racialized (BIPOC) peoples
- LGBTQ+ peoples
- Women’s health and rights

Questions about presentation submissions may be sent to the Program Chairs (Anja Perry, Kevin Manuel, and Jonathan Bohan) at programme@lists.iassistdata.org. 

All submissions should include the proposed title and an abstract. The abstract should be no longer than 300 words and written for a general audience. NOTE: Abstracts longer than 300 words will be returned to be shortened before being considered. Also, if the reviewers can’t understand what a proposal is about, it will be rejected.

MULTIPLE SUBMISSIONS: The conference organizers anticipate that some individuals may wish to submit multiple proposals. We expect to have many submissions, so we would kindly ask you to restrict submissions to one per person only.

### Support for Attending the Conference

IASSIST Fellows Program supports data professionals from countries with emerging economies and underrepresented regions who are developing information infrastructures regarding the use and preservation of public and private data and implementing information policy decisions at their home institutions.

IASSIST Early Professional Fellows Program supports early career data professionals from under-resourced institutions and recognizes the value of new and innovative ideas from graduates and professionals new to data in the social sciences, who may not otherwise have the funding to travel.

Applications can be made on a separate form. Applications will close on 22 February 2023. Please address your questions about the Fellows Program to Fellows Committee Co-Chairs Florio Arguillas (foa2@cornell.edu) and Sarah Young (sarahy@andrew.cmu.edu).

### Presentation Formats

The Program Committee welcomes proposals for the following formats:

**Individual Presentation**
Typically this format is a 15-minute talk. If your individual proposal is accepted, you will be grouped into an appropriate session with similar presentations.

**Panel**
You may propose an entire session (90 minutes) with a minimum of three speakers to “deep dive “into a specific resource or concept. The session proposal can take a variety of forms, e.g., a set of three to four presentations, a discussion panel, a tutorial (with less substance than a pre-conference workshop), a discussion with the audience, etc. If accepted, the person who proposed the session becomes the session organizer and is responsible for securing speakers and a chair. Please note: the names of all speakers and the moderator must be included in the proposal.

**Paper**
Presenters are required to submit an original research paper in advance of the conference and present and discuss its findings at the conference. We will select submissions based on proposals, and the authors of accepted proposals are required to submit their final and complete papers by March 2023. All papers will be eligible for publication consideration in an edition of IASSIST Quarterly. In addition, one paper will be selected as best paper with a prize of one free registration for a future IASSIST conference.

**Posters or Demonstration**
This format is most useful for one-on-one discussions about your research topic or tool demonstration. Proposals in this category should identify the message being conveyed in the poster or the demonstration.

**Workshops**
Successful workshop proposals will blend lecture and active learning techniques. The conference planning committee will provide the necessary classroom space and, depending on need and availability, computing supplies for workshops. Proposals should outline needed computer hardware and software, if any, or specify if participants should bring their own. Typically workshops are half-day with 2-hour and 3-hour options.

Workshops will be held on 30 May 2023. Questions about workshop submissions may be sent to the Workshop Coordinators (Amber Sherman, Deborah Wiltshire, Robert Buwule, and Simon Parker) at workshops@lists.iassistdata.org.

**Lightning Talks**
A lightning talk is a short, highly visual presentation. Presentations in this category are timed, and speakers are restricted to 5 minutes total. Presentations should have a maximum of 15 slides, but there is no restriction on how many minutes you stay on each slide or the exact format of the presentation **as long as you stay within the strict time limit. These are not your typical conference presentations.**

**Birds of a Feather**
There will be a Birds of a Feather session again. The call for it will be published 3 weeks before the conference.

NOTE: When submitting you will be required to select one of the proposal formats above, but it is possible that your submission may be accepted on the condition of adapting it to another format (e.g., an individual presentation proposal might be accepted if you are willing to adapt it to a poster or a Lightning Talk). If this is the case, you will be given the choice to accept this format change or to decline being in the conference program when notified of its acceptance.


### Topic Areas 

**Partnerships and collaborations** – What is the data culture like at your organization? What infrastructure – hardware, software, people or policies – are you leveraging, and is it enough? Who do you partner and collaborate with, both within and outside your own organization, and can we learn from these networking environments?

**Data management and archiving** – How can we build a community of data sharing that is equitable for all? How can we learn from each other’s approaches to demonstrating trust to lay a strong foundation? Have you designed any new and useful approaches and tools that can help in this space?

**Data access, governance and ethics** – As data practitioners we adhere to key principles of protecting human rights and high ethical standards. What principles, practices and tools have you worked on around data access, especially where there may be added risk in data publishing and use.

**Data documentation and reproducibility** – For a data community to persist, members need to share a common data language. What new approaches are you using to design documentation to facilitate our shared understanding? What strategies or tools have you designed that will help us respond best to the current reproducibility ‘crisis’?

**Data literacy** – A robust community includes not only experienced practitioners, but also newcomers. What innovative or successful approaches are you using around the topic of data literacy and how can we, as a community, better equip new practitioners with this important skill?
