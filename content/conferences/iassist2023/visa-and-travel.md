### Basic information about visa requirements for traveling to the USA

The information below is intended as a starting point.  Please confirm current requirements and guidelines directly as conditions may change.

Consult the [Visa Wizard <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/wizard.html) to determine whether you need a visa and which type of visa you will need. [Travel.state.gov <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://travel.state.gov) is the main site for official information on travel from the US Department of State. The Visa Wizard site also links to US Embassy and Conslutate locations, as well as information on visa categories and countries from which a visa may not be required.

If you require a letter of invitation for the conference, please send an email to the Program Committee with your name, institution, mailing address and other contact details.
