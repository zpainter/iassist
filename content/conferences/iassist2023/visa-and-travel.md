### Basic information about visa requirements for traveling to the USA

The information below was intended as a starting point.  Travelers should confirm current requirements and guidelines directly as conditions may change.

Consult the [Visa Wizard <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/wizard.html) to determine whether you need a visa and which type of visa you will need. [Travel.state.gov <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://travel.state.gov) is the main site for official information on travel from the US Department of State. The Visa Wizard site also links to US Embassy and Conslutate locations, as well as information on visa categories and countries from which a visa may not be required.

The Program Committee provided letters of invitation to the conference for those who needed them.
