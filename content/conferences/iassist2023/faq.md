### What are the requirements to obtain a United States Visa?

If you have not already obtained a Visa (if required), you may not be able to get an appointment in time to attend the conference in person. You may want to consider attending virtually. You can find details regarding the United States Visa process here: [https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas.html](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas.html). 

### What is the hotel cost? How do I make hotel reservations?

The conference hotel and location of most meetings will be the [Philadelphia Marriott Old City](https://www.marriott.com/en-us/hotels/phlmo-philadelphia-marriott-old-city/overview/). Please view the [Conference Hotel](https://iassistdata.org/conferences/iassist2023/conference-hotel-and-accommodation/) page of the conference website for more details about the venue, costs, and how to book your room.

### Is there any alternative accommodation?

We strongly recommend staying at the conference hotel if you are able. As IASSIST is hosting this conference without a sponsoring institution, we are not able to offer official alternative accommodation options. There will certainly be other hotels or apartments available but they may not provide a significant savings as we have negotiated a very competitive rate for Center City (downtown) Philadelphia. And you have the added benefit of being in the center of the activity without having additional daily travel time and costs. In addition, the association is responsible for covering the cost of a minimum number of hotel rooms and it would be better to avoid the financial burden of paying for unused guest rooms. 

### What if I cannot attend the in-person conference, will there be an option to attend virtually?

Yes, for 2023 we are offering a Digital ONLY Registration as an option for all participants.

### How can I receive regular updates about the conference?

All Conference Registrants will be added to the Conference Listserv to receive regular updates.

### Will it be the best IASSIST ever?

**Yes, it will be the best IASSIST ever!**
