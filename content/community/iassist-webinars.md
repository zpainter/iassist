#### Incorporating Data Quality into your teaching and research consultations

Join Grace Liu (West Chester University), Bobray Bordelon (Princeton University), Rashelle Nagar (Stanford University), and Jennifer Boettcher (Georgetown University) for a panel discussion on incorporating data quality literacy into instruction and research consultations. They will introduce a new open educational resource on data quality literacy, which features an open-access e-book based on insights from leaders in academia, government, and the corporate sector, shared during the IMLS National Forum Webinar Series. Additionally, the resource offers practical tips and knowledge briefs on data quality topics. The panel will engage the audience in a lively discussion on incorporating data quality and utilizing these open educational materials for teaching and research consultations. These materials were partially made available through an IMLS grant on building the capacity of academic librarians to understand data quality issues and evaluate data quality.
