#### June 12 | An Introduction to ReQual

The workshop will introduce Requal, a lightweight and easy-to-use, free and open source software for coding qualitative data such as interview transcripts, field notes, or text documents, allowing for easy coding, filtering, and export of annotated text segments. Requal works as both a desktop and server application, supporting real-time multi-user collaboration. The main advantage of Requal over similar software is that it provides several reproducibility features and modules that help users increase the transparency and reflexivity of their analyses. 

First, it allows users to specify research-relevant coder attributes, such as gender, experience, age, and ethnicity, and to monitor whether and how these attributes are reflected in coding patterns. Second, it calculates and visualizes the correspondence between codes, coders, and categories of coders, facilitating discussion of intra-team differences. Third, users can view logs of their actions, which supports traceability of coding processes. In practice, Requal is useful for individual researchers, but finds its best use in team-based research and training in qualitative data analysis, where it benefits from its multi-user web operability, ease of use, and reproducibility modules. See: requal.fsv.cuni.cz

About our speaker:

Martin Hájek is an associate professor of sociology at Charles University in Prague. He is co-developer of Requal. He has a long-standing interest in sociological methodology, and especially in text, discourse, and narrative analysis. He is the author of ***The Reader and the Machine: Selected Methods of Social Science Text Analysis*** (Prague, 2015, in Czech).

**Time:** Wednesday, June 12, 2025, 4pm CEST

#### April 29 | An Introduction to Dynamic Data Governance

Welcome to Dynamic Data Governance — a people-first approach where everyone in the organisation plays a role in informing the CDO and governance leaders about data: what they have, where it is, and what it means. It’s about everyday contributions and upskilling the specialists who guide the way. It’s the mindset shift where everyone contributes to governance, and specialists uplift their skills to drive consistent, valuable, and secure data practices across the organization.

This webinar introduces the MAST Methodology — a practical, proven framework to make this shift happen in your organisation. This webinar will tell you how to register for the MAST Methodology Micro-Certification at IASSIST 2025. This credential will help you lead better governance practices across your teams and enhance data outcomes.

About our speaker:

**Sam Spencer** is a long-standing member of the IASSIST community, CEO and co-founder of Aristotle Metadata, and leader in government data management and data governance. Through the development of Aristotle Metadata, Sam has worked on a range of data initiatives across the Australian government, providing input ranging from broader data policy to the development of local metadata teams within departments. Sam is a recognised leader in data management, having presented research on data standards and solutions at conferences in Australia and internationally. His personal goal is to demystify data management and aims to make metadata more accessible to everybody.

**Time:** Tuesday, April 29, 2025, 19:00 AEST

#### May 02 | How does QualCoder Compare with NVivo, Atlas.ti, and MAXQDA?

One of the considerations in adopting and open-source free program is usability and whether it has the same essential features as popular commercial tools. This workshop will look at QualCoder and compare it with these commercial programs on ten dimensions (1) installation and customization; (2) supported files/data types; (3)  workspace, project, file and data management; (4) cases and files classification; (5) memos, annotations and journals; (6) coding (manual, auto and AI assisted); (7) visualization; (8) analysis, querying and reporting; (0) collaboration; and (10) converting to/from other qualitative data analysis tools. Join us to explore the possibilities of QualCoder, a free, open-source qualitative data analysis (QDA) software that can help save time and support many stages of qualitative research. 

About our speaker: 

**Van Tran** is currently the Public Health and Social Sciences Librarian at Temple University. She has also been the Senior Research and Data Librarian, at Harvard Kennedy School, and the Open Educational Resources and Open Access Adjunct Librarian at LaGuardia Community College, City University of New York (CUNY). Prior to this she was an associate program director at the Social Science Research Council, where she worked on developing and implementing interdisciplinary social science research, training, and evaluation.

**Time:** Friday, May 02, 2025, 12:00 EDT

#### March 11 | AI-Driven Data: From Raw Insights to Visual Mastery

In this webinar we will explore the transformative power of AI in the realm of data analysis and visualization. In this session, you'll discover how AI can streamline the journey from raw data to actionable insights by automating tasks such as data review, cleaning, organization, and pre-processing. We’ll also dive into techniques for creating compelling visualizations and demonstrate how AI, when provided with contextual information, can offer valuable recommendations for further research and exploration.

About our speaker:

**Robert Laws** has been working with Georgetown University since 2007 and at the Georgetown University in Qatar (GU-Q) campus since 2008. Throughout this period Robert has played a leading role in teaching students, faculty, and staff about technology. Although Robert's academic background is in history, he has gained a mastery of multiple types of digital skills, including web development, audio and video production, web development, data visualization, and artificial intelligence. He studied history, receiving a BA and MA from George Mason University. Robert received an MLS degree from SUNY at Buffalo.

Robert is currently involved in many different projects at GU-Q, including teaching courses on data visualization and artificial intelligence. Robert has played a leading role in the University's engagement and adoption of emerging technologies and running the Library's Innovation Lab for advanced media and technology teaching and learning since its inception in 2023.

**Time:** Tuesday, March 11, 2025, 11 am EDT / 3 pm UTC / 6 pm AST
