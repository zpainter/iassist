## A. Ethics and Best Practices {#a-ethics-and-best-practices} 

Bias and ethics should be considered at all stages of collecting and using data. Researchers should be aware of their data source's terms of use. They should also follow best practices for personally identifiable information, including deidentification, anonymization, or restricted access for sensitive datasets, and data security. They should also be mindful of institutional IRB requirements and principles of benefits, risks and harm, and laws and regulations on data privacy and data collection and processing, such as the General Data Protection Regulations. Additionally, when generating data, we recommend that data is separated from reports, in order to make it more findable. The below resources offer guidance and background information on ethics and best practices for all stages of research, from collecting, analyzing, using and disseminating data.
