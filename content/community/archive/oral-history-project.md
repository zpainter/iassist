To commemorate IASSIST’s 50th anniversary conferences, the Organizational Archive Action Group conducted Oral History interviews with long-time IASSIST members. IASSIST members were asked to share their memories and reflections on past conferences, to reflect on IASSIST’s impact on their careers, and what they would like to see in the future of IASSIST. 

Interviewees included [Past Presidents](/about/officials/#past-presidents), [Achievement Award](/about/iassist-achievement-award/) winners, and long-serving editors of the [IASSIST Quarterly](/iq/):
