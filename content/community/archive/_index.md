<!--

- how to access the archive – I can write this up. It’s mostly by contacting archivist@iassistdata.org and I want to add the GoogleDrive links to the Oral History Interviews once ready
- who to contact – archivist@iassistdata.org
- IASSIST at 50 feed (linked from on embedded on the page) – Embedded Youtube compilation video, perhaps also linking to the poster which will be uploaded to Zenodo
- Any visual elements needed? – Other than the embedded video, I don’t think so
- one page or pages? If pages, a special navigation may be needed which needs more work – One page for now
