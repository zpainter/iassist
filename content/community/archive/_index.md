Over the years, IASSIST has collected various documents pertaining to its organisational history. These include founding documents, financial reports, conference proceedings, meeting minutes, newsletters, and letter correspondence. 

The IASSIST Archive supports the goals and mission of IASSIST and its membership community by collecting, preserving, maintaining, and making available institutional records of administrative, legal, and historical value. The IASSIST Constitution establishes the role and responsibilities of the Archivist as a non-voting member of the Administrative Committee (see Articles 7.3.3 and 12.3.6).

## How to Access

Items initially archived on paper have subsequently been digitized. As of 2023, the IASSIST Archive is a digital only archive. The IASSIST Archive is not directly accessible online, except for certain sections of the Oral History Project.

Access to records is limited to current administrators and members of IASSIST with the exception of previously published records (e.g. IASSIST Quarterly, conference presentations). If you are interested in accessing materials from the IASSIST Archive, please contact the IASSIST Archivist at archivist ( at ) iassistdata.org and state the reason for your interest.

## IASSIST at 50

The 50th Annual Conference of IASSIST will be held in Bristol, UK, in June 2025. The theme of the conference is “Bridging oceans, harbouring data & anchoring the future”. The 50 years of the association will be celebrated throughout the conference.

### IASSIST 2025 Poster IASSIST at 50: Where Have We Been and Where are We Going

IASSIST 2025 marks the 50th conference for the International Association for Social Science Information Services and Technology (IASSIST). This poster maps the locations of previous conferences and highlights locations and regions that have served as repeated hosts for past IASSIST conferences. As we explore and celebrate 50 years of IASSIST conferences, this poster also demonstrates the geographic gaps and future opportunities for expanding global participation in serving as a conference host and diversifying attendance. One of the hallmarks of IASSIST has been its international perspective. This poster aims to showcase and reflect that trait.

## How to Get Involved?

IASSIST Archive is managed by the Archivist, an ex-officio member of the IASSIST Administrative Committee appointed by the AC for a term of four years. The Archivist obtains records and other documentary materials from former and current officers and from the general membership to document the policies, procedures, and transactions of IASSIST. The Archivist maintains these materials in a digital archive and promotes their use. Volunteers are welcome to help with Archive projects, such as photo identification, records organization, and more!
