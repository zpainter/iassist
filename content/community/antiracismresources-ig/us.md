## Why data on race and ethnicity are collected in the United States

In the period before independence in the United States, the colonial administrations irregularly collected demographic information, including data on race. The 
U.S. government has subsequently collected data on race since the first federal census was taken in 1790.[^1] In the early years, this data collection was in 
support of discriminatory constitutional provisions, laws, court decisions, and policies. Conversely, in later years, federal agencies argued that collection of 
data on race and ethnicity was essential in order to combat discrimination.[^2]

As originally ratified on June 21, 1788, the provisions of Article 1, Section 2, Clause 3 of the U.S. Constitution required an enumeration of the population for 
the purposes of apportionment of representatives and of direct taxes among the states.[^3] That clause excluded “Indians not taxed” and required that an 
enslaved person be counted as only three-fifths of a person.[^4] (Some of the provisions of Clause 3 were later changed by the Fourteenth and Sixteenth 
amendments to the Constitution).

The census of 1790 was designed to enable those (and other) constitutional provisions. During debate in Congress on the exact questions to be asked during the 
first Census in 1790, James Madison successfully argued for further expanding the census questions to include “two age groups of white males, and freedom or 
servitude of the colored population.”[^5] (See Fig. 1.) Thus was “launch[ed] the collection of racial data by the federal government that continues today.”[^6]

*Source: An Act Providing for the Enumeration of the Inhabitants of the United States, Public Law 1-2, Chapter 2, The Public Statutes at Large of the United 
States of America I (1790): 102, [https://www.loc.gov/collections/united-states-statutes-at-large/about-this-collection/](https://www.loc.gov/collections/united-states-statutes-at-large/about-this-collection/).*

Since then, many considerations have influenced how data on race and ethnicity have been collected and how people have been classified in the censuses, 
including politics, policy concerns such as discrimination and civil rights, social attitudes, and the racial demographics of the U.S.[^7] Concern for civil 
rights led to a successful effort in the 1970s to standardize the collection of data on race and ethnicity by federal agencies “in response to needs 
expressed by both the executive branch and the Congress to provide for the collection and use of compatible, nonduplicated, exchangeable racial and ethnic 
data by Federal agencies.” [^8]

As of this writing (2022), the most recent standard for the classification of federal data on race and ethnicity was promulgated by the Office of Management 
and Budget in 1997 after consultation with federal agencies and the public.[^9] That standard introduced the ability for a respondent to report more  than 
one race. The office of the Chief Statistician of the United States, Karin Orvis, began a review of that standard in Summer 2022.[^10] The U.S. Census Bureau 
continues its research on race and ethnicity with the goals of improving the questions and the quality of the data.[^11]

Contemporary uses for data on race and ethnicity are summarized in a 2017 Census Bureau publication:

> These data are required for federal and state programs and are critical factors in the basic research behind numerous policies, particularly for civil 
> rights. Race and ethnicity data are used in planning and funding government programs that provide funds or services for specific groups. These data are 
> also used to evaluate government programs and policies to ensure they fairly and equitably serve the needs of all racial and ethnic groups and to monitor 
> compliance with antidiscrimination laws, regulations, and policies. States also use these data to meet legislative redistricting requirements.[^12]

The evolution of racial and ethnic categorization and the presentation of data can be seen through the Census Bureau’s visualization of categories of race 
and ethnicity for the period 1790-2010 and by comparing the presentations of data from the Decennial Censuses of 1790 and 1890 and the American Community 
Survey of 2019.[^13] (See Figs. 2-4.)
