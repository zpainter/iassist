## Essays on How Different Countries View Race

IASSIST members have contributed essays or resources explaining how their respective nations have viewed or counted racial groups over time.  
Please note that the authors do not claim expertise as researchers in this area.  Rather they are data professionals who help researchers and 
students find data on race, racism, and racial justice. In most cases, they have cited the literature about these issues or compiled 
documentation from their country's official statistics to describe how such counts were done.  Authors were asked to keep entries extremely brief 
to be suitable as blog posts.

If you would like to contribute an essay of your own or a revision to one of these, please email the current chairs of the interest group, listed on [this page](/community/antiracism-resources).

***Please note**:  Due to the historical nature of some of the data sources and topics in these essays, terminology, language, classifications, and methodologies 
necessary for searching may include language that is problematic for and/or offensive to contemporary users. Specifically, vocabulary used to refer to racial, ethnic, 
religious, and cultural groups is specific to the time period when the data were collected and does not reflect the attitudes and viewpoints of contemporary society.*
