## IASSIST is about the Community

Under Community Resources IASSIST members may share professional resources useful to them in their daily work. Current and past Interest Group resources will also be available here, as are links to membership only services like the membership database and discussion list. 

## Jobs Repository

The IASSIST Jobs Repository is a record of job descriptions posted to the membersâ€™ email list from 2005 to the present.

## Webinars

Webinars are free to attend, but a registration is often required. Webinars will be recorded and made available on the IASSIST YouTube Channel.
