### Webinar: “Race & Ethnicity in Latin America” {#feb2024}
08 February 2024 11:00 AM-12:00 PM Eastern Time (US and Canada)

[IPUMS (Integrated Public Use Microdata Series) International <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://international.ipums.org/international/) is dedicated to collecting and distributing census and survey microdata from around the world. The project goals are to collect and preserve data and documentation, harmonize data, and disseminate the harmonized data free of charge. IPUMS International currently disseminates more than 500 census and survey datasets from 103 countries. In this presentation, the presenters will provide an overview of IPUMS (data availability, topical content, harmonization approach, and data access system) with specific emphasis on race, ethnicity and related information in available data from Latin America. Learn about the provenance of the data, the categorizations available, the research and documentation conducted to harmonize (where feasible) and how to access the data. This will include a brief demonstration of the data request system and tabulator if time permits.

#### Webinar: A Conversation About Data on Race & Ethnicity Around the World
30 November 2022 11:00 AM-12:30 PM Eastern Time (US and Canada)

The Black Lives Matter and Indigenous rights movements, as well as international migration in recent years have raised awareness of issues around inequalities because of race and ethnicity. In turn, this has prompted many organizations and groups such as IASSIST to reexamine their own understanding and knowledge, processes and practices. In response, the IASSIST Anti-Racism Interest Group was formed and brought together data stewards and librarians who had some or no prior expertise but who were interested in having a conversation about race and ethnicity in terms of data available for research and exploring how they could support the vital work in this field.

This webinar, brought to you by the Anti-Racism Resources Interest Group and the IASSIST Professional Development Committee, marks the beginning of that conversation with a focus on the data that is available for research. Bringing together a panel of data stewards and librarians from 4 countries - Canada, the US, the UK and Germany - and this webinar aims to discuss and review these key questions:

- How are race and ethnicity recorded in the national Censuses and other key data sources?
- Have these definitions changed over time?
- What groups are identified, how much detail is available?
- What are some of the key issues with these data?

*Please note that the authors do not claim expertise as researchers in this area. Rather they are data professionals who help researchers and students find data on race, racism, and racial justice. In most cases, they have cited the literature about these issues or compiled documentation from their country’s official statistics to describe how such counts were done. Authors were asked to keep entries extremely brief to be suitable as blog posts. Due to the historical nature of some of the data sources and topics in these essays, terminology, language, classifications, and methodologies necessary for searching may include language that is problematic for and/or offensive to contemporary users. Specifically, vocabulary used to refer to racial, ethnic, religious, and cultural groups is specific to the time period when the data were collected and does not reflect the attitudes and viewpoints of contemporary society.
