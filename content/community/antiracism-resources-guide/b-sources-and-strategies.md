## B. Sources and Strategies {#b-sources-and-strategies}

### 1. Resource Guides: Libraries or National Archives can help point you in the right direction {#1-resource-guides}

Depending on where you are looking for data, numerous resources guides exist on topics relating to finding data on the topic of race, anti-racism, and racial justice. The guides can guide you to useful resources, or provide background information on how to begin finding data on your topic. You may also reach out to the creators of the guide with questions.

In North America, librarians often make library guides. Many libraries use a platform called Springshare for creating LibGuides, and you can search across many of these guides at once using the [LibGuides Community site <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://community.libguides.com/). You can also search Google by adding terms from the suggested Search terms and language section and adding "guide" OR "libguide" or "login to libapps" or limit site to libguides.com. Examples: <code>[racial data site:libguides.com <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://www.google.com/search?q=racial+data+site%3Alibguides.com)</code> or <code>[health disparities race data "login to libapps" <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://www.google.com/search?q=health+disparities+race+data+%E2%80%9Clogin+to+libapps%E2%80%9D)</code>

In Europe, national social science data archives often acquire and disseminate data from research projects. See the next section on data archives and repositories on how to find and access data there.

### 2. Governmental Sources: Many government agencies at all jurisdiction levels collect a wide variety of data. {#2-governmental-sources}

Data on the topic may be collected or disseminated by government statistical agencies at all levels: international, national, sub-national, regional, and/or local. Begin by determining whether you need (1) data for a single geographical area or jurisdiction such as the world, a nation as a whole, a sub-national area (e.g. the Canadian province of Ontario), etc. or (2) data for multiple geographical areas or jurisdictions, e.g. each country in the world or each province and territory in Canada. Each country has its own structure, so you will need to understand that structure in order to know where to find the relevant data. Some countries have one central agency that collects all data; others have multiple separate agencies that gather their own data.

Also think about which government agencies at the needed jurisdictional level(s) have responsibility or authority over the topic. For example, if the topic is racial discrimination in education in the U.S. as a whole, look for U.S. federal government agencies that have authority over education and/or those with authority over racial discrimination.

If you have not found the data that you need, ask officials in the relevant jurisdiction(s) about the availability of data. It may also be possible to make a [FOIA request <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://foiaonline.gov/foiaonline/action/public/request) at the US federal level and under similar laws and regulations (open, sunshine) at the [state <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://www.nfoic.org/state-freedom-of-information-laws/) , city and local level. [Other countries also have freedom of information laws <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freedom_of_information_laws_by_country).

Note about harmonization: to compare data across countries or multiple years, the data needs to be "harmonized," which means taking into account the differing collection methods and the meaning and values for each variable.

### 3. Data Archives & Repositories: Collecting data for the long haul. {#3-data-archives-repositories}

Data Archives are purposeful collections of datasets, often with a research or policy focus. In the United States, nonprofit institutes and research center tend to have the largest and most diverse collections of data. In Europe and other countries, national data archives lead the way with a mission to collect and preserve a wide range of research data relevant to the nation. Datasets with individual observations (microdata) suitable for answering more complex research questions are more likely to be found in data archives. Data archives typically also ensure that their data is well-described via codebooks or data dictionaries, and take steps to ensure the preservation and interoperability of data. Repositories operate in the same manner as data archives, but are sometimes less intensively curated, leaving it up to individual researchers to deposit and describe their research data. Archives and repositories are less likely to yield quick answers to questions, but can be very rich sources of the most detailed datasets.

When searching data archives and repositories, take time to learn a bit about the mission and scope of the archive, along with some of the typical types of data that might be found.

Leading archives and repositories are listed below, along with select examples of resources that may be of interest for research on race, ethnicity, and diversity issues. Web of Science Data Citation Index (subscription required) and [Google Dataset Search <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://datasetsearch.research.google.com/) may be used to search data available in archives and repositories.

#### Examples {#examples-data-archives-repositories}

- [Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR) <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/) , and its topical archives such as the [Resource Center for Minority Data <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/pages/RCMD/) , form the largest social science data archive in the world. Datasets such as [TransPop <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/ICPSR/studies/37938) (surveying transgender individuals) and the [Collaborative Multi-racial Post-election Survey <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/web/RCMD/studies/38040) (CMPS) are available here. While data is predominantly from the US, there are rich international collections as well.

- [IPUMS <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://www.ipums.org/) variety of national and international data, including census, health surveys, GIS boundary files, time use, and higher education. The variables are harmonized across time and space to allow for longitudinal studies and international comparison.

- [Roper Center for Public Opinion Research <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/) for survey data contains general polls and specialized ones like the [Washington Post Survey of Black Americans <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://ropercenter.cornell.edu/ipoll/study/31117505).

- The [Social Science Japan Data Archive <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://csrda.iss.u-tokyo.ac.jp/english/infrastructure/) and the [Australian Data Archive <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://ada.edu.au/) are examples of other national data archives outside of the US, Canada, or Europe.

- Specific initiatives can provide rich data on specialized topics. For example,

  - Germany has a Research Data Center infrastructure with two RDCs that focus on migration: [Research Data Centre of the Federal Office for Migration and Refugees (BAMF-FDZ) <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://www.bamf.de/EN/Themen/Forschung/Forschungsdatenzentrum/forschungsdatenzentrum-node.html;jsessionid=3E089076C2826E070CAC5C2ABBA1A197.intranet262) and [Deutsches Zentrum fur Integrations-und Migrationsforschung (DeZIM) <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://www.dezim-institut.de/forschungsdatenzentrum-dezimfdz/ueber-das-forschungsdatenzentrum/). DeZIM data feeds into the [Racism Monitor <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://www.rassismusmonitor.de/).

  - [The Black Wealth Data Center <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://www.blackwealthdata.org/) collects information on how race influences factors that contribute to wealth in the US.

- The [re3data <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://www.re3data.org/) registry of research data repositories is an excellent place to discover additional data archives and repositories.

### 4. Commercial Databases: Facts may not be copyrighted, but there is a growing market for social science statistical databases found in well-financed libraries. Here are few established titles that include racial variables. {#4-commercial-databases}

Most of these will start with a single search box. It is recommended you use the advanced search to get to specific data needed. Each source will have its own controlled vocabulary/thesaurus. All support boolean logic, it's good to explore different words in your search string, for example: (african american OR black)

#### Examples {#examples-commercial-databases}

- Sage's Data Planet (subscription required): offers interactive charting features as well as data retrieval

- Statista (subscription required): offers (static) charts for many statistics as well as data retrieval

- Roper Center for Public Opinion Research (subscription required)

- [Latin American Public Opinion Poll <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/lapop/data-access.php) (LAPOP) (subscription required; some data available openly): data are designed to be comparable cross-nationally and over time

- Social Explorer (subscription required): limited free data; offers mapping features as well as data retrieval

- ICPSR has free access to open data sponsored by governments and nonprofits. AND there is commercial side of ICPSR associated with academic research (subscription required)

### 5. Think Tanks, Research Centers, and Non-Governmental Organizations: Look for relevant educational institutions, nonprofits, philanthropies, businesses, or other private organizations. {#5-think-tanks-research-centers-and-non-governmental-organizations}

Educational institutions, nonprofits, businesses, and private organizations commonly conduct or sponsor projects on the topic and provide data online. Be aware that they may charge a fee to access the data. Search websites of organizations known to collect, analyze and disseminate racial justice and racial equity related data. In the US, they include the ACLU, Urban Institute, Vera Institute, and the Prison Project. Universities also have research centers that focus on racial equity, racial justice, health equity, or anti-racism research. There are a growing number of community based organizations that are supported to collect, analyze, use and disseminate racial equity related data. Searching for a [library research guide listing anti-racism and racial justice data organizations, <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://guides.library.ucla.edu/c.php?g=1117422&p=8159972) is one way to discover them. Other strategies, as listed below, include searching grant databases, using organization index and directories, and internet searching. You can also use the strategies mentioned in the section on Social Networks: Social Media, Community Listservs, Professional Associations, to post data requests and search for other data organizations and research centers.

If you think an organization has the data, go to that organization's website and use their search or browsing tool. They may also have a research hub or database for searching research reports, studies, and evaluations. You may also want to contact them directly to make inquiries about relevant data. Data from any sources must be carefully examined for sound methodology and adherence to ethics and best practices.

#### Search organization and think tank index and directories {#search-organization-and-think-tank-index-and-directories}

Use organization and think tank index and directories to search by keywords or available topics for special interest, research centers, and advocacy organizations. Their URL can be added after "site:" along with keywords when using a search engine, such as Bing and Google. Countries may also have governmental and non-governmental academies of sciences or research centers for the natural or social sciences that link many different disciplinary research centers, such as the [Chinese Academy of Social Sciences <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](http://english.cssn.cn/) and [Max Planx Society <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://www.mpg.de/en).

### 6. Funders and grantees: Organizations and agencies may collect and share the data generated by projects that they fund or for which they have received funding. {#6-funders-and-grantees}

Identify private "racial equity" funders from the [Funding for racial equity <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://candid.org/explore-issues/racial-equity#stats-chart) (Candida, Foundation Directory Online) Candid worked in partnership with the Philanthropic Initiative for Racial Equity (PRE) to define and track Racial Equity funding worldwide. The data come from "IRS filings, direct reporting by grantmakers, and other public sources, such as foundation websites and news articles." Funders may have a learning and evaluation site that may include studies, research reports and evaluations so look for these and search their grant database. These reports are often not published in academic databases. Relevant reports may identify surveys and studies and the researchers or project team or funder could be contacted to ask about available datasets.

Government agencies also fund projects with relevant data and increasingly are requiring funded grant data to be shared. Universities may post international funding sources for research (See an [example <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://www.usf.edu/world/for-faculty/funding-resources/index.aspx)). Within scholarly and academic article databases such as PubMed (free), ERIC (free), SCOPUS (subscription required) and Web of Science (subscription required), funding sources or sponsors may be indexed that can lead to other studies with similar data. There is also an emerging movement of "data philanthropy" calling on private companies to share data for social good or public benefit.

### 7. Scholarly Works: Look for scholarly publications on the topic, including journal articles, dissertations and theses, and books. {#7-scholarly-works}

Some authors of scholarly publications may conduct their own research and make their data available in publisher's or institutional repositories. Other authors may cite available data collected by others. Read the notes, bibliography, and text of scholarly publications to find citations to or mentions of sources of available data. Citing data has become more expected in the past 10 years. If not mentioned in a bibliography, see if the author included statistical sources in notes, you might have to look at the full image of an article to see if it includes tables, then in the graphic's caption may be the only reference to the source of the data. The publisher of the article might have the data used in the article on their webpage or link to it. You can also use Data Citation Index from Web of Science (subscription required) to identify data sources. There are also [data specific journals <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://www.wiki.ed.ac.uk/display/datashare/Sources+of+dataset+peer+review) for reviews of datasets.

Many scholarly publications are available through [Google Scholar <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://scholar.google.com) and other open repositories. Use [OpenDOAR <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://v2.sherpa.ac.uk/opendoar/) to find other open repositories. Local libraries often provide limited access to scholarly publications, but access to those databases may not be available remotely. Universities often offer public access to walk-in users and may have subscriptions to a wider range of scholarly publications than public libraries, along with specialized indexes to search scholarly works–contact the library to ask.

#### Example articles {#example-articles}

- Lizarazo Pereira, Diana Marcela. [Moved by Racial Justice: The Role of Kama muta in Collective Action toward Racial Equity among Advantaged and Disadvantaged Racial Groups <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](http://urn.nb.no/URN:NBN:no-91526). Master Thesis, University of Oslo. 2021.

- Dennis, Christopher, Marshall H. Medoff, and Michele N. Gagnier. "The impact of racially disproportionate outcomes on public policy: The U.S. Senate and the death penalty." _The Social Science Journal_ 35, no. 2 (1998): 169-181.

#### Example search strategies {#example-search-strategies}

- Search by the "Official" demographic name and add filetype:.xls. For example: <code>blackfeet filetype:xls</code>

### 8. Newspapers, Magazines, & Trade Publications: Examine current newspapers and magazine articles for specific topics. {#8-newspapers-magazines-trade-publications}

Search newspapers and magazines that cover an industry, a local area, a region, a country, or the world. Sometimes journalists conduct their own research and make their data available through the publication's website. Other times they report on the research of others and may refer where the data are available or identify the organization that has done the study you are interested in. Or your researchers might have to purchase the data the journalists use.

Some articles may not include the data they write about, but the reporters should have cited what institution who is responsible for publishing it. When searching in these sources use quantitative words like: statistical, increase, decrease, rate, measures, analytics, empirical, study/studies, survey, count, patterns, per capita, per person, per unit, analysis, not just the word data.

Local libraries often have subscriptions to local, regional, or national newspapers which may enable you to access back issues, but access may only be available to library card holders or to walk-in patrons. Universities often offer public access to walk-in users and may have subscriptions to access publications from a wider geographic area or targeting specific audiences than public libraries–contact the library to ask about database access.

#### Example search {#example-search}

- Use Google to search the website of a publication such as the MetroWest Daily News: <code>"racial justice" AND policing AND data AND site: www.metrowestdailynews.com</code>

- [Chronicling America: Historic American Newspapers <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/newspapers/?state=&ethnicity=African+American&language=) includes searchable digitized images of African-American local and regional newspapers (1880-1963). Remember to search with contemporary terms of those days.

- [Google Newspapers <i class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></i>](https://news.google.com/newspapers?hl=en) lets you search across many open newspapers.

### 9. Social Networks: Social Media, Community Listservs, Professional Associations: Ask questions and learn from others through social networks. {#9-social-networks}

Many professional associations, listservs, and even social media platforms have robust networks and conversations about finding data. Some listservs may require membership and you may find and ask a member to post a data request for you. Depending on the venue, you can "lurk" to learn from others, ask specific questions, or share your knowledge with others.
