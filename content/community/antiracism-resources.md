## Anti-Racism Resources 

In the wake of the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and  Ahmaud Arbery in 2020, among other (on-going) acts of violence against African Americans in the U.S., members of IASSIST felt compelled to gather materials that can help all of us better recognize, acknowledge and combat inherent racial bias. These members formed the Anti-Racism Resources Action Group in December of that year to compile the resources linked here.

Resources are grouped into two categories:

Under construction:  Sources of data (in .csv format) on a variety of topics but all documenting racism and the Black experience internationally.
Under construction:  Articles/toolkits/rubrics (in .csv format) for building anti-racism into the process of working with data across the research lifecycle.


The group is also collecting essays to briefly summarize [varying national perspectives about collecting data by race](/community/antiracismresources-ig/essays).

Finally, the Action Group is co-sponsoring with IASSIST's Professional Development Committee (PDC) webinars on related topics.  Our first one is coming up soon:

*A Conversation About Data on Race & Ethnicity Around the World*
Nov 30, 2022 11:00 AM-12:30 PM Eastern Time (US and Canada)
The Black Lives Matter and Indigenous rights movements, as well as international migration in recent years have raised awareness of issues around inequalities because of race and ethnicity. In turn, this has prompted many organizations and groups such as IASSIST to reexamine their own understanding and knowledge, processes and practices. In response, the IASSIST Anti-Racism Interest Group was formed and brought together data stewards and librarians who had some or no prior expertise but who were interested in having a conversation about race and ethnicity in terms of data available for research and exploring how they could support the vital work in this field.

This webinar, brought to you by the Anti-Racism Resources Interest Group and the IASSIST Professional Development Committee, marks the beginning of that conversation with a focus on the data that is available for research. Bringing together a panel of data stewards and librarians from 4 countries - Canada, the US, the UK and Germany - and this webinar aims to discuss and review these key questions:

- How are race and ethnicity recorded in the national Censuses and other key data sources?
- Have these definitions changed over time?
- What groups are identified, how much detail is available?
- What are some of the key issues with these data?

The webinar will last 90 minutes and will include plenty of time at the end for a Q&A and comments from the audience.

Presenters:
Framing of the Issues: Anne Zald - Northwestern University
Canada: Kevin Manuel - Toronto Metropolitan University
United States: Barbara Levergood - Bowdoin College
United Kingdom: Deborah Wiltshire - GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences
Germany: Anja Perry - GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences
