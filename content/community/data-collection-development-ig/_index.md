The mission of the **Data Collection Development Interest Group (dataCDIG**) is to build community and share experiences and insights on data acquisition and its challenges, such as licensing, storing, curating and providing access. We believe that institutions of all sizes and resources have these and other challenges and can add to the collective conversation that benefits all.

Our objectives are to

- bring together a group of professionals and raise awareness about data collection approaches and share good practices
- organize webinars and other relevant professional training opportunities
- create and facilitate spaces for open and honest dialog about issues and practical ideas
- provide resources for IASSIST members

## Discussion Series

The IASSIST dataCDIG invites you to join us for a new discussion series in 2025-2026. 

These sessions will be an hour long in duration, and will start with a short presentation on a topic followed by open discussion. All participants are encouraged to join in the conversation.  No matter your years of experience, everyone will have something to contribute and will take away something to apply in your work. 

For event details and registration links, join the ***dataCDIG list-serv*** (see instructions below).
