The **IASSIST Qualitative Social Science & Humanities Data Interest Group (QSSHDIG)** was founded in October 2016 to bring together researchers and those working in data infrastructure to share and create resources to support good management and use of qualitative data throughout the data lifecycle. As part of this objective, we aim to:

1. connect an informed group of professionals working with qualitative data,
2. raise awareness about key issues and debates in qualitative research,
3. provide opportunities for professional development through training, and
4. amalgamate and create resources for all IASSIST members to better understand working with qualitative data.

We support a wide range of disciplines, methods, and roles who work with qualitative data. We organise informal, quarterly meetings as an opportunity to network, discuss emerging issues and technology that support qualitative work and update the interest group on the latest opportunities for training.
