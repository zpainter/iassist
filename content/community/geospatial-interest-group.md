The central purpose of the **IASSIST Geospatial Interest Group** is to create a network for members focused on issues of geospatial data as related to the social sciences.

**Example topics include:**

- management and curation (e.g., best practices, integration of spatial and non-spatial datasets, preservation, metadata, etc.)
- geospatial data collections & licensing
- geospatial data resources (e.g., NHGIS)
- tools and applications (e.g., industry standards, Open Source, web based, mobile etc.)
- linked, open data advocacy
- GIS services models
- user support (e.g., questions from patrons)
- problem solving (e.g, approaches to geocoding, joining spatial and attribute data)
- geospatial awareness (e.g. promotion to new users)
- documentation of spatial processing
- geospatial discovery and access (e.g. portals, metadata, visualisation)

**The IGâ€™s shared goals are to:**

- regularly communicate through eLists, meeting at the annual conference and contributing to a community wiki
- regularly contribute to the IASSIST blog
- create a list of resources and tips linked to the IASSIST website
- develop and/or share practices, standards and protocols
- develop a knowledge base of archived problems
- look for opportunities for collaboration and engagement
- training and skills development (e.g., tools, geospatial data use, resources)
- establish core competencies and guidelines for GIS services in the social sciences
- develop advocacy and statements with regard to open data
- promote map literacy

Expected outcomes include developing a connected and informed group, opportunities for professional development through training, shared professional tools, resources for all IASSIST members to make use of, both members and non-members of the IG, and an elevated awareness of social sciences and place.
