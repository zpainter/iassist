In the wake of the murders of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and Ahmaud Arbery in 2020, among other (on-going) acts of violence against African Americans in the U.S., members of IASSIST felt compelled to gather materials that can help all of us better recognize, acknowledge and combat inherent racial bias. These members formed this group and compiled the resources linked here. We continue the work under the name of Representation in Data Interest Group, (formely Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Data Resources Interest Group).

## Our mission

Our mission is to provide resources and educational opportunities to better recognize, acknowledge, and combat inherent biases in the creation, collection, and use of data for the study of discrimination. We target all forms of discrimination, including but not limited to immigrant status, ethnicity, race,  gender and gender identity, sexuality, religion, class, disability and the intersectionality of these aspects. Our work is informed by an actively anti-racist, anti-sexist, anti-colonial, and anti-discriminatory stance. We aim to ensure a global scope in our work, as discrimination varies in form and impact geographically. 


## We are currently working on these topics

- Anti-Racism
- Accessibility and Inclusion
- LGBTQ+
- Indigenous Data
- Gender Data Gap
