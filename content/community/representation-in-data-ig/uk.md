## United Kingdom
There is a long history of recording ethnicity in the UK, with ethnicity questions first introduced into the Census in 1991 (White, 2012, Ballard, 1996). 
Support for this was not unanimous; some argued recording ethnicity would in fact increase discrimination (Ballard, 1996).  Debates followed about how to 
capture the multi-faceted nature of ethnicity and since 1991, the number of ethnic group categories used has increased from 9 to 18 (White, 2012).  Many 
social surveys also collect information about ethnicity. Some like the UK Household Longitudinal Study take a multi-characteristic approach (Connolly, et 
al. 2016), collecting information on ethnic group, country of birth, parents and grandparents country of birth, national identity and childhood language 
as well as experiences of discrimination (University of Essex, 2021). Whilst much progress has been made, the issue of small sample sizes among minority 
groups remains unresolved (Kapadia, 2021).
