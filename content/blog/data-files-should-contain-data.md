For those tech-types who do their own data munging, here's a [rant from
Mark
Dominus](http://blog.plover.com/misc/census-data.html "Dominus blog link"),
a Perl programming wizard who was briefly stymied by trying to process a
large data file from Census. As we face these issues daily in my office,
I thought I'd share the frustration!

Of course, he doesn't mention where he thinks metadata "should" go
but I have a pretty good idea what he would suggest.... ;-)
