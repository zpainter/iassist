> "Before the Clark, there was a large degree of interaction among these
> three units," Green says. "Our new proximity, in a purposefully
> designed and equipped space, means that we can more effectively
> collaborate with each other, which in turn really enhances our ability
> to creatively collaborate with students, faculty, and researchers."
