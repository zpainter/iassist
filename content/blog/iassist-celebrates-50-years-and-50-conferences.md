At the IASSIST 2024 conference, the Organizational Archive Action Group was formed to commemorate IASSIST’s 50th anniversary conference: IASSIST 2025. Action Group members included: Margaret (Peggy) Adams, Meryl Brodsky, James Capobianco, Michele Hayslett, Thomas Lindsay, Christine Nieman Hislop (IASSIST Archivist & Action Group Coordinator), Zac Painter, Cindy Severt, and Wei Yin. 

## Oral History Project

The Action Group decided to take on two projects in preparation for the conference. One was to conduct oral history interviews with long-time IASSIST members. Interviewees were asked to share their memories and reflections on past conferences, reflect on IASSIST’s impact on their careers, discuss significant projects they took on as IASSIST members, such as the development of the IASSIST Quarterly, and what they would like to see in IASSIST’s future. The Action Group conducted and recorded 9 interviews via Zoom. 

Interviewees included several Past Presidents, Achievement Award winners, and long-serving editors of the IASSIST Quarterly:

The Action Group also created a short compilation video for presentation at the IASSIST 2025 conference. This ten minute video shares some of the highlights from the oral histories, with an emphasis on conferences. <!--This video is posted on IASSIST’s YouTube channel: [insert YT URL] -->

## Conference Map

The second project the Action Group undertook was to create a map of past conferences. This map shows the locations of all conferences, pre-ordinal meetings, and workshops from 1974-2025, including the workshops offered by the Africa Chapter. It highlights locations and regions that served as repeated hosts for past IASSIST conferences and it demonstrates the geographic gaps and future opportunities for expanding global participation. One of the hallmarks of IASSIST has been its international perspective. This map was shared as a poster titled "IASSIST at 50: Where Have We Been and Where are We Going" during the poster session at the IASSIST 2025 conference.
