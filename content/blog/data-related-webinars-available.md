The [North Carolina Library Association's Government Resources
Section](http://www.nclaonline.org/government-resources) runs a webinar
series. In addition to having [some data-related webinars on
YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLB4ehI6iUJT7jFAEZJ7S7BizGQ93idnQ5),
our upcoming August webinar may be of interest to IASSIST members.

**Help! I'm an Accidental Government Information Librarian presents ...
Accessing Datasets for the Data Curious**

The Government Resources Section of the North Carolina Library
Association welcomes you to a series of webinars designed to help us
increase our familiarity with government information. All are welcome
because government information wants to be free.

Directing patrons to subscription repositories of data like ICPSR and
Roper is a useful service that any reference librarian can learn to do.
But can the generalist take data-seeking patrons just a little bit
further before referring to the data librarian? This webinar will help
the generalist or subject librarian learn ways to help patrons download
data successfully, use documentation to explore the relevance of a
dataset to answer a question, and alert patrons to common pitfalls and
patterns. Participants will learn strategies to apply their librarian
expertise for finding and accessing information to the rarified realm of
datasets.

Presenter Kristin Partlo is the Reference & Instruction Librarian for
Social Science and Data at Carleton College in Minnesota. She has been
helping undergraduates find and evaluate data for over ten years and
especially enjoys looking for connections between research data services
and other areas of librarianship. Her MA of LIS is from the University
of Wisconsin, Madison.

We will meet for Session #49, online on Wednesday, August 12 from 12:00
-- 1:00 p.m. (Eastern). Please RSVP for the session by August 12 at
10:00 am using this link:  <http://tinyurl.com/grs-session49>

Technical requirements: We will be using collaborative software called
Blackboard Collaborate. It requires that you be able to download Java
onto your computer, but you do not need any special software. After you
RSVP, we will send you a link that you can use to test the software. If
you have any questions, please contact Lynda Kellam
(<lmkellam@uncg.edu>). You do not need a microphone as a chat system is
available in the software, but you do need speakers or headphones.

We make recordings available on our website
(<http://www.nclaonline.org/government-resources/help-im-accidental-government-information-librarian-webinars>)
and our YouTube channel
