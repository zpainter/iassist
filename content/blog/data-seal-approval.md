The [Data Seal of Approval](http://www.datasealofapproval.org/) is a
certification for data repositories who have demonstrated that they can
ensure that in the future, deposited research data can still be
processed in a high-quality and reliable manner, without entailing new
thresholds, regulations, or high costs.
