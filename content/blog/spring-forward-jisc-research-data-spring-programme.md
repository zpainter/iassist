On 26/27 February, I attended Jisc Data Spring "[Sandpit
1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B9pnqy-EhKsBbW1tMFhGQlZLTWM/view)"
in the English city of Birmingham. [Data
Spring](http://www.jisc.ac.uk/rd/projects/research-data-spring) is a
funding programme supporting UK based projects in Research Data
Management (RDM), and something of a successor to the successful
[Managing Research Data
programmes](http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20140702233839/http:/www.jisc.ac.uk/whatwedo/programmes/mrd.aspx) (MRD)
that did so much to get RDM training and tools underway in the UK's
education sector.

Unlike the traditional proposal-evaluation-funding model, Data Spring
takes a more collaborative, interactive approach, splitting the
programme into separate stages at which projects may no longer receive
funding. If that sounds like the approach of entertainment modern TV
shows, then you would not be wrong to think that. Beginning with an open
call, some 70 proposals were available online for voting and comments.
These reduced to 44 by the time of a
[workshop](http://www.dcc.ac.uk/files/blog/IDCC%20Research%20Data%20Spring%20programme%20Jisc.pdf)
[PDF] at the recent IDCC conference. At the "Sandpit" (metaphorical,
not literal, sadly), these proposals had to fit 27 available slots to
proceed to the next stage. Through a process of negotiation, mergers and
acquisitions, and hasty matchmaking, all 44 managed to get through in
some form from the first day to the second.

The second day consisted of the now 27 projects making four-minute
pitches to a panel of judges. By mid-March, successful projects will
receive notice of three months testing and prototype funding before
reporting to a similar event in June. Following this event, projects may
receive a further four months of funding before a final workshop in
November allows six months of funding leading to the programme's
conclusion in 2016.

Having been part of the JISCMRD Program (Jisc has since switched to
sentence case from caps), it was notable how much the area has moved on
since those days. From evidence gathering and basic training tools to
RDM support focused on integration into existing workflows. That this
occurred is a testament to the original MRD programme, and the support,
work, and imaginations of those involved. Whatever projects make it
through to the end of Data Spring, I have no doubt they will be worth
the attention of people involved in Research Data Management both inside
and outside the UK.

You can review projects at the Data Spring
