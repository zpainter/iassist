Special issue: The organizational dimension of  digital preservation

Welcome to the special double issue 3 & 4 of the IASSIST Quarterly (IQ)
[volume 36
(2012)](http://www.iassistdata.org/downloads/vol36_3v4full.pdf). This
special issue addresses the organizational dimension of digital
preservation as it was presented and discussed at the IASSIST conference
in May 2013 in Cologne, Germany.

The two guest editors Astrid Recker and Natascha Schumann from the GESIS
Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences in Cologne have earned special
thanks. If you find their names familiar it is because they co-wrote a
paper in the IQ 36-2. They are concerned with data preservation and
curation at the Data Archive for the Social Sciences, and as a member of
the Archive and Data Management Training Center, Astrid also trains
others in these areas. Furthermore, they co-chaired the  panel on
'Beyond Bits and Bytes: the Organizational Dimension of Digital
Preservation' at IASSIST 2013, both also participating as panelists in
the session. They have now persuaded the other panelists to contribute
to this combined special issue. Thanks also therefore to Michelle
Lindlar, Stefan Strathmann and Achim Oßwald, and Yvonne Friese.

Articles for the IASSIST Quarterly are always very welcome. They can be
papers from IASSIST conferences or other conferences and workshops, from
local presentations or papers especially written for the IQ. Authors are
permitted "deep links" where you link directly to your paper published
in the IQ. Chairing a conference session with the purpose of aggregating
and integrating papers for a special issue IQ is also much appreciated
as the information reaches many more people than the session
participants, and will be readily available on the IASSIST website at
<http://www.iassistdata.org>.

Authors are very welcome to take a look at the instructions and
layout:http://iassistdata.org/iq/instructions-authors.
Authors can also contact me via e-mail: [kbr@sam.sdu.dk](null).

Should you be interested in compiling a special issue for the IQ as
guest editor(s) I will also be delighted to hear from you.
