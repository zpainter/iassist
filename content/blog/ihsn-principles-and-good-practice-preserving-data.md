The [International Household Survey Network](http://www.ihsn.org) (IHSN)
just released a new publication on "[Principles and Good Practice for
Preserving
Data](http://ihsn.org/home/index.php?q=focus/principles-and-good-practice-preserving-data)".
This document produced by the Interuniversity Consortium for Political
and Social research (ICPSR) provides basic guidance for managers in
statistical agencies who are responsible for preserving data using the
principles and good practice defined by the digital preservation
community. The guidance defines the rationale for preserving data and
the principles and standards of good practice as applied to data
preservation; documents the development of a digital preservation
policy; and uses digital archive audit principles to suggest good
practice for data.

The document is available
at <http://ihsn.org/home/index.php?q=focus/principles-and-good-practice-preserving-data>
