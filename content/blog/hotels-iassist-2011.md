We have learned that there will be a very large conference in Vancouver
at the same time as ours (5,000 people!), resulting in a real rush for
hotel bookings. 

Regrettably rooms are no longer available at the Delta, Ramada, Days Inn
and Victorian Hotels nearby (although you might check later for
cancellations).

Important!  We encourage you to book as soon as possible, even before
you have permission from your institution (you can always cancel if it
turns out you can't attend).

For the latest information on the latest listing of accommodations visit
the [conference
site](http://www.rdl.sfu.ca/IASSIST/index.php/Accommodations).
