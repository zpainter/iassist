Luis Martinez-Uribe, Digital Repositories Research Co-ordinator, is
based at the Oxford e-Research Centre and will be conducting a scoping
study to capture researcher's needs for repository services to manage,
curate, preserve and disseminate research data generated in Oxford.

A new blog (<http://oxdrrc.blogspot.com/>) has been set-up to record the
progress of the project while disseminating outputs and information
about relevant activities. If you are interested in following the
progress of this project you can subscribe to the RSS feed
