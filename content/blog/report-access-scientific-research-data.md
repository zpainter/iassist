The final report of the Canadian National Consultation on Access to
Scientific Research Data has just been released containing eighteen
recommendations to improve open access to research data in Canada. While
some of these recommendations are unique to the Canadian context, others
share a close relationship with the recommendations of the International
Council for Science report, *Scientific Data and Information*.Supported
by the National Research Council of Canada, a task force was established
in June 2004 to provide advice about improving access to scientific
research data. ![NCASRD
Report](http://datalib.library.ualberta.ca/~humphrey/ncasrdimage.jpg)The
task force, with support from the Canada Foundation for Innovation,
Canadian Institutes of Health Research, Industry Canada, Natural
Sciences and Engineering Research Council, and Social Sciences and
Humanities Research Council, just released its [**final
report**](http://ncasrd-cnadrs.scitech.gc.ca/NCASRDReport_e.pdf) last
week (June 2005).

 

The impetus for this consultation came out of a mix of international and
national pressures. Internationally, the issue of access to research
data received recognition when the OECD Committee for Scientific and
Technological Policy at Ministerial Level approved a
[declaration](http://www.oecd.org/document/15/0,2340,en_21571361_21590465_25998799_1_1_1_1,00.html)
in January 2004 asking the OECD to take further steps toward proposing
principles and guidelines on access to publicly-funded research data.
Nationally, the natural science, technical and medical research
communities felt compelled to respond to the 2002
[report](http://www.sshrc.ca/web/whatsnew/initiatives/da_finalreport_e.pdf)
from the National Data Archive Consultation completed on behalf of the
Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council and the National
Archives.

 

This most recent report, which contains eighteen recommendations,
specifically addresses the ethics of sharing data, privacy, archiving,
anonymisation, data-at-risk, data management plans and training new data
librarians and archivists (recommendations 5, 6, 7, 9, 10, 13 and 18,
respectively). The content of these recommendations are familiar to
IASSIST members since they are also concerns expressed in the IASSIST
Strategic Plan.

 

Furthermore, the outcomes of this Canadian report are closely related to
findings in a study by the International Council for Science released in
December 2004, [**Scientific Data and
Information**](http://www.icsu.org/Gestion/img/ICSU_DOC_DOWNLOAD/551_DD_FILE_PAA_Data_and_Information.pdf)

.

 

These reports are evidence that increasingly common ground around issues
of data access and preservation is emerging across some disciplines and
national boundaries.
