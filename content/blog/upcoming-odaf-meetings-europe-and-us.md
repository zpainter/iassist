The Open Data Foundation is pleased to announce that an ODaF Europe 2008
meeting will take place at the UK Data Archive on April 14-15. This
regional event is open to all members as well as individuals and
agencies interested to learn more about ODaF or to share ideas. For
further information and registration, see

Looking into the future, we currently anticipate holding a US regional
meeting on Oct 2-3 at the Sun Microsystems headquarters in Manhattan, NY
and our Annual Meeting in Washington DC in December. The Institute for
the Study of Labour (IZA) in Germany and the Open Data Foundation (ODaF)
are also happy to announce that ODaF Europe 2009 will be hosted on the
IZA campus in Bonn next spring (details to be announced in time).
