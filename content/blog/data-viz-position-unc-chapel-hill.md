Please see the announcement below for a new position created here in the
Libraries at UNC at Chapel Hill.  It will be based in our Digital
Research Services Department (you'd get to work with me and a bunch of
other great people!) supporting the mission of our [Research
Hub](http://library.unc.edu/Hub/) in Davis Library.  Note that there is
a requirement for an advanced degree, but a master's or PhD in a related
subject field is admissible in place of a library degree.  Please let me
know if I can answer any questions.
