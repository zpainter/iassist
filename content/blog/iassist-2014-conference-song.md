Sung to the tune of Gordon Lightfoot'sÂ  "If You Could Read My Mind";
thanks to San, Paula, Bill, and Vince for their suggestions, and Vince,
Dan and Kate for helping to drown out my own voice :) If anyone has a
video version of this, send me the link, so I can add it here:

If you could read my data<br />
What a tale these points would tell<br />
At Toronto's IASSIST 40<br />
Data folk began to dwell<br />
At the hockey game<br />
We began to meet<br />
With colleagues and old friends<br />
These meetings never end<br />
Aligning data with infrastructure of research is what it's all about

If you were at this IASSIST<br />
Many fantastic talks you heard<br />
All of the sexy specialists<br />
Seemed to tweet on what they heard<br />
When you reached the talk 'bout the data dude<br />
The seating was all gone<br />
The tweeting would go on<br />
We don't want the talks to end<br />
Because excitement's just too hard to fake

Chuck walked away with the plenary<br />
When the speaker didn't show<br />
Improv -- way to go!<br />
IASSIST's big tent will cover everyone who works with data now<br />
We will show them how<br />
The Steam Whistle banquet was great<br />
Where we could get more beer with tickets<br />
Myron's talk went slightly wrong, his script was gone but he managed to<br />
get it back

If you could read my hashtag<br />
You'd have seen some tweets galore<br />
How Justin Hayes raps data<br />
Declare variables not war<br />
Robin's free at last, 'cause her session's done<br />
And Bit Rot Bitter's cool<br />
The tweeting never ends<br />
If you read the twitter feed<br />
You soon will see the many things we do<br />
The talent's always there<br />
We always seem to feel this way<br />
And we've got to say that we really get it<br />
The only thing that seems so wrong<br />
Is the long time before we meet again.
