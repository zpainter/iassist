Dear IASSIST members,

The Data Management & Curation Good Practice Action Group has been
working this past year to compile a list of links and resources related
to Data Management & Curation.

This group has been charged with "collecting a set of existing resources
and links from among the membership to create a resource page on the
public website covering the topics of good practice, standards, and
activity in Data Management and Data Curation".

Our focus is on the audience of the IASSIST membership. We tied the
scope of this project to the IASSIST Strategic Plan. Basically, we are
working to create a web resource which will provide information and
resources directly related to the following areas:

-   Policies for making research data accessible
-   Practices in making research data accessible
-   Resources on responsible data curation
-   Data Management Plans

In keeping with the outlined project scope, we have gathered information
in the following areas:

-   guides to data management,
-   tools for data management planning,
-   sample and template data management plans,
-   resources for data curation,
-   funder policies

Our resource page is now live on the IASSIST website:

<http://www.iassistdata.org/resources/category/data-management-and-curation>

Please take a look at the resources we have listed. If you are aware of,
or are responsible for, great resources or tools that are not listed,
and do fall within the criteria above, please send the information to
our group at : <iassist_dmag@googlegroups.com> **by May 13, 2011**. We
will add them to the site. This is just a starting point. We apologize
in advance if your resources were not included in this preliminary stage
of development.

This site is intended to be an active resource which can and should be
expanded upon over time. It is our hopes to establish a new IASSIST
Action Group to be responsible for maintaining the site.

There may also be topics of interest which are not listed due to the
scope of our project, for instance, we have decided at this point not to
include sites on related topics such as advocacy, data communities, data
lifecycles, data creation best practices, data use, metadata, data
ethics, preservation, and professional development.  We are mindful that
these are important issues, but needed to start with a more limited
scope. There may be future opportunities for IASSIST members to gather
information on areas outside the scope of this group.

If you have any ideas or comments on the resources listed or any other
aspect of the project, please feel free to contact us. We are looking
forward to receiving your input. Again, our deadline for input on this
phase of the project should be sent to us **by May 13, 2011**.
