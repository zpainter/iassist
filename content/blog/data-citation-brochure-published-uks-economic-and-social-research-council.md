Just to let you all know that here at the Economic and Social Data
Service in the UK we have been working with the ESRC on a brochure to
encourage data citation amongst our social scientists and journal
publishers.

In October 2011 we minted over 5000 DOIs for our ESDS Collection with
Datacite, using a methodology we developed to deal with version changes
to our data.  You can view our
[Webinar](http://www.jisc.ac.uk/events/2012/04/webinardataidentifiers.aspx "Data citation webinar")
that explains how we do this. We have also spoken at various Datacite
events.

We are currently sending out over 1000 brochures to all the major UK and
key European social science publishers and professional societies in the
UK.  View [our
brochure](http://www.esds.ac.uk/news/publications/data_citation_online.pdf "ESRC Data Citation brochure")
and feel free to borrow from it!
