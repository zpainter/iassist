The [Penn State University Libraries Data Management
Toolkit](http://www.libraries.psu.edu/psul/researchguides/pubcur/datatoolkit.html)
provides resources to help orient teaching and research faculty, as well
as undergraduate and graduate students, around the topic of data
management planning. While some sections are dedicated specifically to
PSU students, faculty and staff, a large majority of the toolkit may be
used generally by the public and offers great information on data
management, planning, and sharing. The site also provides links to other
institutions and organizations that offer resources on similar topics.
