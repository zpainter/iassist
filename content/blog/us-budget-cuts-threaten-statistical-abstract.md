When the big news broke last month that the US Census Bureau is
[proposing budget
cuts](http://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/pscinfoserv/?p=1814) that would lead
to the demise of the Statistical Compendia Branch, including the beloved
*Statistical Abstract*, the library listservs lit up with concern. 
It's not too late to take action if you haven't already notified your
representatives about this issue.  There are now several venues where
you can add your voice:

-   Sign the [Change.org
    petition](http://www.change.org/petitions/save-the-statistical-abstract-of-the-united-states-2#?opt_new=t&opt_fb=f)
-   Contact your representatives via the[ALA Legislative Action
    Alert](http://capwiz.com/ala/callalert/index.tt?alertid=37054501) or

You can read more about the issue in [Information
Today](http://newsbreaks.infotoday.com/NewsBreaks/US-Census-Bureau-to-Eliminate-Strategic-Publications-Including-Statistical-Abstracts-74588.asp)
and [Library
Journal](http://www.libraryjournal.com/lj/home/889924-264/statistical_abstract_faces_an_untimely.html.csp). 
Interestingly, the LJ article references commentators who believe that
Data.gov could be a viable replacement for the *Stat Ab* (which I
refuted), but even the [future of
Data.gov](http://sunlightfoundation.com/savethedata/) isn't necessarily
secure.
