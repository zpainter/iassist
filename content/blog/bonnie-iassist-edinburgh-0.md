[IASSIST 2005](http://datalib.ed.ac.uk/iassist/index.shtml), hosted in
Edinburgh from May 24-27, was a rousing success with over 200
participants attending over the four days of conference and workshops.
There were many highlights, including a record number of presentations,
an earth-shattering reception at *Our Dynamic Earth*, a joyful
conference banquet and ceilidh at the Roxburghe Hotel, a maze of
outstanding posters and demonstrations, two thought-provoking plenary
sessions and a new conference wrap-up song by Melanie. Watch the
[IASSIST conferences](http://www.iassistdata.org/conferences/) page for
the posting of the [multimedia
presentations](http://www.iassistdata.org/conferences/2005/presentations/)
from the twenty-five sessions. Plans are also under way to make photos
available from the conference. We will keep you posted.
