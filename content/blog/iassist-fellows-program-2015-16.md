The IASSIST Fellows Program is pleased to announce that it is now
accepting applications for financial support to attend the IASSIST 2016
conference in Bergen [<http://iassist2016.org/>] from data
professionals who are developing, supporting and managing data
infrastructures at their home institutions.

Please be aware that funding is not intended to cover the entire cost of
attending the conference. The applicant's home institution must provide
some level of financial support to supplement an IASSIST Fellow award.
Strong preference will be given to first time participants and
applicants from those countries currently with insufficient
representation at IASSIST. Only fully completed applications will be
considered. Applicants submitting a paper for the conference will be
given priority consideration for funding.

You may apply for funding via this
form<**<http://tinyurl.com/jsutx9z>**>. The deadline for applications
is the 31st of January 2016.

For more information, to apply for funding or nominate a person for a
Fellowship, please send an email to the Fellows Committee chairs, Florio
Arguillas (<foa2@cornell.edu>) and Stuart Macdonald
(<stuart.macdonald@ed.ac.uk>)

All best wishes
Stuart Macdonald & Florio Arguillas
