One of the enduring challenges of qualitative research is translating research questions and data to specific steps for analysis. Few methods for qualitative research come with step-by-step instructions; researchers have to decide how to organize, structure, and interpret data in ways that allow them to answer their research questions and meet the expectations of their audiences, from dissertation advisors and instructors to peer reviewers. This challenge is exacerbated by the tendency of published reports of qualitative analysis to devote limited space to the process of analysis and interpretation.  

One way to build a repertoire of qualitative data analysis strategies is to learn from the variety of ways in which other researchers have conducted their analysis, as in the edited volume ***[How qualitative data happens: Moving beyond "themes emerged" <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://search.worldcat.org/en/title/1427567667)*** (and the [first edition <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://search.worldcat.org/title/1073036858) in 2012). Previous QSSHDIG leaders have also explored these questions in the blog series ***[But how do I \*do\* qualitative research? <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](/blog/2017/07/17/how-do-i-do-qualitative-research-bridging-gap-1/)***. 

Inspired by these approaches, the QSSHDIG Leadership Team will offer a **series of webinars in 2026** where researchers go behind the scenes of their data analysis to show how exactly they go about the work of qualitative research. 

We expect the series will spark new ideas for both novice and experienced qualitative researchers. For information professionals providing data services to qualitative scholars, the presentations will offer a look at the challenges and techniques used by an often under-served group of researchers. 

The series will be offered in collaboration with the IASSIST Professional Development Committees. Students and professionals in any discipline are invited to apply, as well as those using any type of data or technology (or no tech at all). Presentations will be recorded and shared on the [IASSIST YouTube channel <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC315efmsReDcFbWHpWBmb9g). 

Please direct questions to Jess Hagman at jhagman ( at ) illinois.edu. Proposals are due December 12, 2025 at 5pm CST. We’ll contact selected speakers in January 2026.
