The Research Data Management Training, or MANTRA project has produced an
open, [online training course](http://datalib.edina.ac.uk/mantra) for
PhD and early career researchers to learn best practices in data
management.

In addition to the interactive, online module which covers data
management topics such as Organising Your Data, there are downloadable
[software
modules](http://datalib.edina.ac.uk/mantra/softwarepracticals.html)
covering data handling skills in SPSS, R, NVivo and ArcGIS.

The resource was created by EDINA and Data Library, University of
Edinburgh, and was funded by the JISC Managing Research Data programme.
