Guest editors from the QSSHDIG Leadership Team invite **proposals for a special issue of IASSIST Quarterly on Aligning Qualitative Data Services with Open Science and Access**. 

In 2019, members of the IASSIST Qualitative Social Science & Humanities Data Interest Group ([QSSHDIG](https://iassistdata.org/community/qualitative-social-science-and-humanities-data-interest-group/)) edited an IASSIST Quarterly special issue ([Vol. 43, No 2 <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://iassistquarterly.com/index.php/iassist/issue/view/140)) focused on extending data services to qualitative research by exploring training, service visibility, transparency, and reuse practices. 

A second special issue of IASSIST Quarterly is warranted to explore qualitative data through the lens of FAIR, CARE, open science, and access. (We consider qualitative data to include textual, audiovisual, and other non-numeric formats.)  Given the recent global and disciplinary trends in open science and data, it is timely to revisit the qualitative data landscape to advance concepts, theory, and practices that support transparent, trustworthy, and accessible qualitative research now and into the future. 

**Proposal abstracts are due January 31, 2025** with full papers due April 30, 2025. See the [full call for proposals <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://iassistquarterly.com/index.php/iassist/announcement/view/7) for additional information and potential topics.
