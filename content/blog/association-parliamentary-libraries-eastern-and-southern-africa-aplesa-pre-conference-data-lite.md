Through its Membership Committee's event sponsorship program, IASSIST
recently sponsored a one day pre- Conference Training Workshop on Data
Literacy for the Association of Parliamentary Libraries of Eastern and
Southern Africa (APLESA). The workshop aimed to help librarians acquire
data literacy skills in order to produce statistics/data that can be
used for reporting and evidence based planning.

The workshop was held at the Makerere University School of Computing and
Information Sciences, Kampala, Uganda, attracting over 30 participants
from Malawi, Uganda, Angola, Zimbabwe, Kenya, Botswana and Mozambique.
Attendees came from from Parliaments, government departments, academia
and publiclibraries.

The workshop was facilitated by Ms. Winny Nekesa Akullo, the IASSIST
Event Liaison Coordinator and Prof. Constant Obura-Okello, who is also
the Dean of East African School of Library and Information (EASLIS). Mr.
Simon Engitu, the Secretary of APLESA was the workshop moderator.

In his opening remarks, the President of APLESA, appreciated the support
from IASSIST and the importance of the workshop, emphasizing the value
of data in reporting and planning. With the theme of conference "Taking
Parliament to the People: the Role of Parliament Libraries in Bridging
the Gap between the People and Parliament". There is need for the
Parliament libraries to work together with Research Services departments
to improve research data management and data literacy skills.

The workshop topics included data and storytelling; basics of data
literacy and its importance, and basics of data visualization using
RAWgraphs. During sessions, participants were assigned group work
related to topics and discussed their group work.

Ms. Nekesa informed the participants that they don't need to be
statisticians to carry out data management, but as librarians they need
to gain data literacy skills to support researchers and other patrons.
We need to illustrate and inform public opinion, substantiate for others
what we already know using data which will provide a basis for evident
based planning. Hence there is need to learn to generate and analyze the
data we receive in the libraries and better serve our clients.

Prof. Obura reminded the participants that that data literacy is the
ability to understand and use data effectively to form decisions. He
informed them that data literacy is a new concept in Africa and
therefore, there is need to include it in LIS curriculum and train data
librarians who are able to handle data requests from researchers and
other clients.

Feedback from workshop participants indicated overwhelming satisfaction
with content. They also recommended to form a member's forum; a workshop
on integrated data literacy into the academic curriculum; a training of
trainers of data literacy technical working group; and form technical
working groups for data literacy in Eastern and Southern Africa

An interim working group was formed to further the interest of data
literacy in the Eastern and Southern Africa.
