Mandy kicked off our 4-part blog series last week with an [inaugural
post](http://iassistdata.org/blog/how-do-i-do-qualitative-research-bridging-gap-between-qualitative-researchers-and-methods-resou)
that provided background and context for this project, which centers
around a specific challenge faced by many qualitative researchers: lack
of qualitative methods training.  This post offers some concrete ideas
to data-support professionals on how to leverage library collections and
other information sources that direct researchers to secondary and
tertiary sources on qualitative methods to address this issue.

Possibly the most basic yet high-impact way to bridge the gap between
researchers and qualitative methods is to create a LibGuide---or any
other online research guide or pathfinder---dedicated to qualitative
research resources.  It can be embedded within an existing resource,
such as a library's Data Services page or a course-specific guide, or it
can exist as an independent guide unto itself.

Now, I know what you're thinking: when faced with an instructional or
research need, a librarian's knee-jerk reaction is often, "Let's make a
LibGuide!"  While research guides aren't necessarily appropriate for
every topic or service we provide as information and data specialists
(i.e., LibGuides aren't a panacea, *per se*), they can be a useful
didactic medium for culling and delivering information and resources
specific to qualitative research methods.   

Online research guides, like LibGuides, allow researchers to benefit
from the guidance and expertise of a data-support professional in an
autonomous, self-paced manner.  This type of learning object is
well-suited for researchers who fit the profile [Mandy described in her
introductory post for this
series](http://iassistdata.org/blog/how-do-i-do-qualitative-research-bridging-gap-between-qualitative-researchers-and-methods-resou):
those who aren't getting formal qualitative methods training and need to
get up to speed quickly on their own, and/or researchers with varying
degrees of qualitative methods knowledge and experience who would like a
set of materials, sources, and resources to which they can refer back
periodically.  The portability of a LibGuide also makes it convenient
for use by data-support professionals in mediated settings, such as
consultations or instruction sessions.  And at institutions where demand
for research methods and tools training outstrips an individual or
staff's capacity to provide one-on-one or even course-embedded support,
a LibGuide can solve the scalability problem for a large and diverse set
of needs (although, obviously, not all of them).  Lastly, LibGuides
aren't just for researchers; they also serve to assist colleagues and
fellow information and data specialists in providing reference and
research services at an institution (and beyond) and are an effective
tool for cross-training.  This last point is relevant especially for
fairly specialized, niche areas of expertise, like qualitative research
methods.

 A number of qualitative research guides already exist and are worth
checking out (e.g., Duke University Libraries' guide on [Qualitative
Research](http://guides.library.duke.edu/qualitative-research) by Linda
Daniel, UCSF Library's [Qualitative Research
Guide](http://guides.ucsf.edu/QualitativeResearch) by Evans Whitaker).
 Below are some suggestions for content to include---with a focus on
resources related to learning about qualitative methods---if one were to
consider creating anew or building on an existing qualitative research
guide.

***Select bibliography of relevant literature***

A centralized bibliography, or simply citations/links dispersed
throughout a guide, can be useful in directing users to relevant
secondary and tertiary sources to learn more about qualitative research
methods.  Citations to the following literature types may be appropriate
to include:  

-   canonical works and textbooks on qualitative research design and
    methods more generally (e.g. [*Qualitative Research Design: An
    Interactive
    Approach*](https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/qualitative-research-design/book234502),
    [*Qualitative Analysis for Social
    Scientists*](http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/sociology/research-methods-sociology-and-criminology/qualitative-analysis-social-scientists?format=PB#CKgajQv9eyFqG2BI.97))
-   authoritative background information on major methods (e.g.,
    [*Qualitative Interviewing: The Art of Hearing
    Data*](https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/qualitative-interviewing/book234196))
    and possibly those that are less common, more highly specified
    (e.g., ["The Extended Case
    Method"](http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1111/0735-2751.00040)),
    or mixed methods (e.g., [*Designing and Conducting Mixed Methods
    Research*](https://us.sagepub.com/en-us/nam/designing-and-conducting-mixed-methods-research/book233508))
-   journals that focus on publishing about qualitative methods (e.g.,
    [*Qualitative Research*](http://journals.sagepub.com/home/qrj)) or
    publishing research using qualitative methods (e.g., [*Qualitative
    Sociology*](https://link.springer.com/journal/11133))
-   empirical research articles (or books) that illustratively employ a
    particular method (since researchers who are new to a method often
    ask for examples of qualitative studies to see both how they are
    conducted as well as how they are written up) (e.g., ["'We'd Be
    Free': Narratives of Life Without Homophobia, Racism, or
    Sexism"](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3760739/))

As a companion, it may be useful to link to relevant catalogs and
social-sciences databases to search for additional literature and
research.  However, not all catalogs and bibliographic databases index
research methods, and even those that do often don't index qualitative
methods with appropriate granularity.  Thus, it may be necessary to
provide tips on how best to search for studies that employ qualitative
methods (e.g., NYU Libraries' guide on [Locating Qualitative
Research](http://guides.nyu.edu/qualitative) by Susan Jacobs).  This
way, a guide delivers select sources but also teaches users how to find
additional methods-related sources themselves.

***Links to subscription-based resources***

There are a number of specialized library databases designed for quick
reference and/or in-depth, self-guided learning, and these serve as rich
fonts of information about qualitative methods.  Three possible
resources that fit this bill are:   

-   [Credo Reference
    ](http://search.credoreference.com/)While not specific to research
    methods, Credo is a multidisciplinary, searchable collection of
    digitized reference works (e.g., dictionaries, encyclopedias, and
    handbooks) that provide helpful background information on a topic
    but also act as springboards to connect users to further readings
    and cross-references.  Credo can serve as a good starting point for
    researchers looking to learn more about qualitative methods in
    general or about a particular methodology.   

<!-- -->

-   [Sage Research Methods Online (SRM)
    ](http://methods.sagepub.com/)SRM is an online multimedia collection
    devoted to research methods (qualitative and quantitative), with a
    special emphasis on research skills training.  It includes
    e-versions of SAGE's [Little Blue
    Books](http://methods.sagepub.com/Search/SavedSearch/440), an
    instructional series on qualitative research methods, as well as
    many other searchable, full-text interdisciplinary SAGE reference
    and journal sources that allow users to deep-dive into a particular
    method at each stage of the research lifecycle.  SRM also provides
    resources for teaching qualitative methods, including case studies,
    sample datasets, and instructional videos.
    
-   [Oxford Bibliographies Online (OBO)
    ](http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/)OBO offers access to online,
    peer-reviewed, annotated bibliographies that are organized by
    discipline and are written by experts in their fields.  One can find
    entire bibliographies or portions of a bibliography dedicated to
    qualitative methods in a given field of social science (e.g.,
    [sociology](http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199756384/obo-9780199756384-0043.xml),
    [political
    science](http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199756223/obo-9780199756223-0107.xml?rskey=gDpfrP&result=190))
    or to a particular qualitative methodology (e.g.,
    [anthropology](http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199766567/obo-9780199766567-0107.xml),
    [education](http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/view/document/obo-9780199756810/obo-9780199756810-0175.xml)).
     This makes OBO a good source of information for discipline-specific
    qualitative research methods.  

In addition to researchers, these resources can be indispensible to
data-support professionals who are asked to consult on research projects
using qualitative methods outside their own specializations, or who are
asked to consult with researchers who sit in (or between) disciplines
with which they are less familiar or comfortable.

***List of professional development and ongoing learning
opportunities***

Researchers who are new to a qualitative research method may want to
learn more about it in an interactive manner beyond (or in lieu of) the
classroom.  Opportunities to do so are plentiful and varied, and may
take the following forms:

-   webinars (e.g., ["Successful Qualitative Research: Don't Get Too
    Comfortable!"](http://connection.sagepub.com/blog/sage-connection/2015/06/02/successful-qualitative-research-webinar-recording-with-extended-qa/)
    by Kristi Jackson)
-   workshops (e.g., courses offered at[ResearchTalk's Qualitative
    Research Summer
    Intensive](http://researchtalk.com/upcoming-events/))
-   local communities of practice (e.g., CIRA's [IRM Core Qualitative
    Research
    Workgroup](http://cira.yale.edu/events/irm-core-qualitative-research-workgroup-9),
    which is open to the Yale University community)
-   professional associations, which may be stand-alone (e.g.,
    [Association for Qualitative Research](https://www.aqr.org.uk/)) or
    nestled within a larger discipline-specific association (e.g.,
    [Society for Qualitative Inquiry in
    Psychology](http://qualpsy.org/))
-   conferences (e.g., [Ethnographic & Qualitative Research
    Conference](http://www.eqrc.net/))

I hope you have enjoyed my suggestions in this post!  They are by no
means exhaustive.  I would love to here what you think, what you would
add, or what you're already using on your guides to address the
qualitative methods gap discussed in this series of blog posts.
