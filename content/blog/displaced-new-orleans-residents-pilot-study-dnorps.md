The [Displaced New Orleans Residents Pilot Study
(DNORPS)](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/DSDR/studies/29523) is a
brand new dataset added to the ICPSR-hosted website "[Data Sharing for
Demographic
Research](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/DSDR/index.jsp)". Access
appears to be available to all users, not just ICPSR member
institutions.

The Displaced New Orleans study was a 2006 pilot study "designed to
examine the current location, well-being, and plans of people who lived
in the city of New Orleans when Hurricane Katrina struck on August 29,
2005. The study is based on a representative sample of pre-Katrina
dwellings in New Orleans. Fieldwork focused on tracking respondents
wherever they currently resided, including back to New Orleans. "

Data are available at the Census Tract level and for households and
individuals.
