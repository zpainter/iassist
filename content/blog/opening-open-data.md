The conference theme for IASSIST 2007, **Building Global Knowledge
Communities with Open Data**, is very timely given new interest in
defining and describing the open data concept. This week Peter
Murray-Rust, who spearheads the SPARC-Opendata discussion list, posted a
message announcing his entry for [**Open
Data**](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_Data) in the Wikipedia and
inviting others to contribute to this entry.

Robin Rice responded to Peter's message with a copy of the IASSIST call
for papers, which resulted in the following obervation from Peter:
"Many of [the topics in the call for papers] have a close overlap
with the topics at the Science Commons meeting and it is clear that
**Open Data** is likely to become more widely used. It will be
particularly interesting to see what comes from ***the principles of
open data***, which I think is a key area the list should be
concentrating on. It will be very useful if these can be formulated in
such as way that they complement (or extend) things like the Open Access
declarations."

The [Science Commons meeting](http://www.spatial.maine.edu/icfs/) to
which Peter is referring occurred October 2-3, 2006 in Washington, D.C.

Also announced on the SPARC-Opendata list yesterday was the release of
the final report from the ARL-NSF consultation from the end of September
2006. [**To Stand the Test of Time: Long-term Stewardship of Digital
Data Sets in Science and
Engineering**](http://www.arl.org/info/events/digdatarpt.pdf) is
available at the [ARL
website](http://www.arl.org/info/frn/other/ottoc.html) (see our blog
entry [Academic libraries and data](http://iassistblog.org/?p=47) for
more information about this consultation.)
