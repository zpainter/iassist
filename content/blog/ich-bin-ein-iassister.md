From 28-31 May, [GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social
Sciences](http://www.gesis.org/en/home/ "GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences")
hosted the [39th Annual Conference of the International Association for
Social Science Information Service and
Technology](http://www.iassist2013.org/iassist-2013-home/ "IASSIST 2013"),
aka
[#iassist2013](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23iassist2013&src=typd "IASSIST 2013 tweets")

IASSIST conferences provide an overview of what's happening in
information technology and data services and allow exchange of ideas
between participants working in different backgrounds - from social
science and humanities to information and computer science. The aim of
this year's event was to help us move closer to the dream of technical
and organizational measures that make research data discoverable and
accessible.

Two-hundred and eighty five participants were welcomed to Cologne by
GESIS President York Sure-Vetter ahead of a program of workshops,
presentations, posters and discussions around this year's topic of
"Data Innovation: Increasing Accessibility, Visibility, and
Sustainability".

The first day of the conference offered eight
[workshops](http://www.iassist2013.org/program/workshops/ "IASSIST 2013 Workshops"),
providing participants the opportunity to look at specific topics like
licensing data, data visualization or DOI assignment. Sessions on a
variety of tools and methods were also offered, specifically the OLAP
analysis method, R open source software, and CharmStats - GESIS's newly
developed data harmonization software which was formally launched at
IASSIST.

Over the following three days there were a total of three plenaries and
32 [concurrent
sessions](http://www.iassist2013.org/program/sessions/ "IASSIST 2013 Concurrent Sessions") organized
in three tracks.

Presentations and discussions were concentrated in the track "Research
Data Management" (RDM). This embraced a spectrum of topics related to
all aspects of the data lifecycle. Emphasis was on policies, strategies
and tools to support researchers in managing their research data. In
addition presentations demonstrated various supporting collaborative
infrastructures and virtual research environments at institutional,
national or international level. Another focus was data citation and
publications to enhance discoverability of data and professional credit
for data sharing. Additional discussion offered answers to the question
of how responsible use of complex or sensitive data can be facilitated.
Finally sessions in the RDM track dedicated themselves to the subject of
data curation and long-term preservation.

The track "Data Developers and Tools" presented a technical point of
view with offerings from those working in application development --
seasoning their work with a good dash of metadata. Questions were asked
and solutions presented on the topics of interoperability,
interconnection and integration, and preservation of data. A special
role here is played by the DDI metadata standard to which many tools and
applications have been introduced to simplify the creation and
management of DDI metadata or provide value-added services on setting
the standard up.

The track "Data Public Services/Librarianship" confronted aspects of
access to research data. Here, development of data services from
country-specific perspective (Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Croatia)
was highlighted, but the track also managed to look at specific data
types (non-digital, historical, confidential and sensitive data).

Slides of the presentations and video recordings of selected events will
be published in the coming weeks on the IASSIST website providing you an
opportunity to plunge into the world IASSIST 2013. Let's do it all again
in Toronto for IASSIST 2014!
