ESDS Government has produced a new guide, The R Guide to ESDS
Large-Scale Government Surveys. The aim of this guide is to provide an
introduction to analysing large scale government surveys with the help
of the R statistical software package. 

The guide focuses on providing step-by-step examples of common
operations most users carry out in the course of their research: how to
open data sets, do basic data manipulation operations, produce simple
descriptive statistics or weighted contingency tables.

It should be noted however that this guide is not an introduction to R.
Beginners should use it in conjunction with one of the more
comprehensive guides available online. Links and information about R
resources are available at the end of the guide, which is available from
<http://www.esds.ac.uk/government/resources/analysis/>
