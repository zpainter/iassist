Here it is, at long last - the words to the 2015 IASSIST conference
song! Thanks to: Melanie Wright for her excellent guitar work, singing,
and help with lyrics; Lisa Neidert, for lyric ideas; and the
self-proclaimed Data-ettes (Daniel Edelstein, Joanne Webb, Kakia
Chatsiou, Mandy Swygart-Hobaugh, Victoria Mitchell), for their
enthusiasm and wonderful work singing the choruses. A link to a video
will be added once someone informs me of its existence!

**WE ARE IASSIST** (*to the tune of "Little Red Corvette", by Prince*)

I guess we should have known,<br />
The Minnesota crew would always put on a show<br />
The theme for this year's conference<br />
Bridging the data divide<br />
Would tell where we'd go

Tweets were coming out now, workshops were so great,<br />
They told us what we should know<br />
Then it was Tuesday night, beginning IASSIST right<br />
We said "Now it was time to go"

*(And then we all say)*

*We're at IASSIST!*<br />
*It will go much too fast*<br />
*Now it's IASSIST!*<br />
*Data nerds will make it last*

Wednesday sessions started,<br />
The rain began as well and it never seemed to stop;<br />
Census nerds heard stories, goats & sheep were heard too,<br />
The quality never dropped.

At the business meeting,<br />
Tuomas was our new prez; we saw the donut chart;<br />
Then it was poster session time, and more discussion time,<br />
Food & drink to make us smart.

*(Now we all say)*

*More of IASSIST!*<br />
*Bill and Bo see the Stones*<br />
*It's still IASSIST!*<br />
*Tweets make us feel we're not alone.*

Facebook's maximising profit or altruistic bridging<br />
the divide in the Internet?<br />
Challenges for training, ideas for curation<br />
Constructive arrogance and more yet.

Using web cam data, lying metadata authors<br />
Pechachkas were the best<br />
Wine data, pie, it's always better with cats,<br />
Bergen surprised with trolls and metal death.

*(We say)*

*Banquet time IASSIST!*<br />
*Celebrate on the right bank;*<br />
*Dancing at IASSIST!*<br />
*That page was purposely left blank ...*

Friday's protein breakfast<br />
Coffee, cake, and Danish, the day was then in our hands;<br />
Training data users, challenges of linking,<br />
Using data management plans

Our plenary speaker told us<br />
Open Data Geeks have unfair advantages<br />
More sessions make us wise, now it's closing wrap-up time,<br />
What an amazing conference it was!

*(because)*

*That was IASSIST!*<br />
*It was the best one ever,*<br />
*Next year's IASSIST*<br />
*See you all in Bergen next year!*
