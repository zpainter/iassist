Here it is, at long last - the words to the 2015 IASSIST conference
song! Thanks to: Melanie Wright for her excellent guitar work, singing,
and help with lyrics; Lisa Neidert, for lyric ideas; and the
self-proclaimed Data-ettes (Daniel Edelstein, Joanne Webb, Kakia
Chatsiou, Mandy Swygart-Hobaugh, Victoria Mitchell), for their
enthusiasm and wonderful work singing the choruses. A link to a video
will be added once someone informs me of its existence!

**WE ARE IASSIST** (*to the tune of "Little Red Corvette", by
Prince*)

I guess we should have known,
The Minnesota crew would always put on a show
The theme for this year's conference
Bridging the data divide
Would tell where we'd go

Tweets were coming out now, workshops were so great,
They told us what we should know
Then it was Tuesday night, beginning IASSIST right
We said "Now it was time to go"

*(And then we all say)*

*We're at IASSIST!*
*It will go much too fast*
*Now it's IASSIST!*
*Data nerds will make it last*

Wednesday sessions started,
The rain began as well and it never seemed to stop;
Census nerds heard stories, goats & sheep were heard too,
The quality never dropped.

At the business meeting,
Tuomas was our new prez; we saw the donut chart;
Then it was poster session time, and more discussion time,
Food & drink to make us smart.

*(Now we all say)*

*More of IASSIST!*
*Bill and Bo see the Stones*
*It's still IASSIST!*
*Tweets make us feel we're not alone.*

Facebook's maximising profit or altruistic bridging
the divide in the Internet?
Challenges for training, ideas for curation
Constructive arrogance and more yet.

Using web cam data, lying metadata authors
Pechachkas were the best
Wine data, pie, it's always better with cats,
Bergen surprised with trolls and metal death.

*(We say)*

*Banquet time IASSIST!*
*Celebrate on the right bank;*
*Dancing at IASSIST!*
*That page was purposely left blank ...*

Friday's protein breakfast
Coffee, cake, and Danish, the day was then in our hands;
Training data users, challenges of linking,
Using data management plans

Our plenary speaker told us
Open Data Geeks have unfair advantages
More sessions make us wise, now it's closing wrap-up time,
What an amazing conference it was!

*(because)*

*That was IASSIST!*
*It was the best one ever,*
*Next year's IASSIST*
*See you all in Bergen next year!*
