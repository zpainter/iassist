The US [Open Government Directive](http://www.whitehouse.gov/open),
released on December 8, 2009, instructs all federal agencies to provide
high-value information to the public online in open, accessible,
machine-readable formats. This adds to the momentum already in place at
[Data.gov](http://www.data.gov/) to "increase public access to high
value, machine readable datasets generated by the Executive Branch of
the Federal Government." The [Open Knowledge Foundation
blog](http://blog.okfn.org/2009/12/08/us-government-announces-more-open-government-data/)
describes progress to date and milestones to come.

The UK government also recently announced similar plans to open up data,
and the imminent launch of a new Data.gov.uk developer's site.

Another [Open Knowledge Foundation
blog](http://blog.okfn.org/2009/12/07/uk-government-announces-lots-of-new-open-data/)
post summarises what we can expect, including the release of the
following the datasets: # public services performance data - including
on crime, hospitals and schools # new transport data # geospatial data
from Ordnance survey

Tim Berners-Lee has advised both governments to release data in a way
that will add to the [Linked Data](http://linkeddata.org/) Web, paving
the way for the realization of his envisaged Semantic Web.
