In February I won sponsorship money from IASSIST for a Data Workshop I
had in mind. On the 18 November this year I saw my idea come to life.
This Data Workshop was aimed at Library student and newgrads and was
held in the Ferguson Room of the National Library of Australia. 26
people attended and there were five speakers from industries adjacent to
librarianship.

1.  Sam Spencer from Data61, CSIRO
2.  Steven McEachern from the Australian Data Archive
3.  Karen Visser from the Australian National Data Service
4.  Ingrid Mason from the Australian Academic and Research Network
5.  Riley Post a PhD Candidate from University of Canberra

My goal for this workshop was to get students, newgrads and those new to
data to start thinking about the fundamentals when it comes to managing
data. Those fundamentals are things like:

-   Where are you storing your data, do you know where your servers a
    located, have you checked your backups lately?
-   What are the types of data librarians manage today?
-   Getting an idea of the big collaborations in place, the ways people
    are using data and organisations/platforms that manage data for
    users.

 Sam and Ingrid presented attendees with a sample of the vast amount of
standards for managing topic and profession specific data. Attendees
engaged quite well with these speakers and asked technical questions and
wanted to know their expectations from librarians in their current role.

Steven highlighted the National [Collaborative Research Infrastructure
Strategy
program](https://www.education.gov.au/national-collaborative-research-infrastructure-strategy-ncris),
and its National Research Infrastructure roadmap. I could see attendees
were interested in how organisations like the Australian Data Archive
fit into such programs. Steven said that a lot of work is still going on
at the digitisation stage and I saw many of the library students realise
that digitisation skill is worth developing.  

Karen demonstrated how easy (within three minutes) it is for people to
find their own research data. She then enforced that our job as current
or aspiring data librarians is to add value. We should be data
connectors and be ready and poised to share that knowledge with people,
for example, "Oh you are looking for biodiversity data? Do you know
about Atlas of Living Australia or the Biodiversity Heritage Library?"

Many commented they enjoyed having Riley speak last as his presentation
was a great visual representation of what can be done with data. He is
working in the field of "[generous
interfaces](http://mtchl.net/towards-generous-interfaces-for-archival-collections/)"
and he demonstrated what people like him can do with data if it is
created well. I was particularly thankful that he linked his
presentation back to "I wouldn't have been able to create this, if the
data wasn't created to this standard". After Sam's presentation where he
laid out most of the standards it helped people to realise how far well
created data can actually go.
