As I prepare to leave Guelph there are lots of things I will miss - but
what I will maybe miss most is the [Data Resource
Centre](http://www.lib.uoguelph.ca/resources/data_resource_centre/) and
the creative people who work there.   If you link to the picasa album
below you will see some awesome posters they have made to showcase
services and bring people into the world of Data and GIS. The images on
some of the posters are really powerful....
