Bill Hooker has written a nice article about ensuring that the data
behind published scientific literature are made openly available.

[Where are the data? Can I have them? What can I do with
them?](http://www.sennoma.net/main/archives/2006/12/where_are_the_data_can_i_have.php)
(17 Dec, 2006).

He takes a practical approach based on the perspective of a researcher.
His title says it all.

> ...an Open Data addendum must at least answer my opening questions:
> it must point to the online, freely accessible location of the raw,
> un-hamburgered data; it should make clear that yes, you can have them;
> and it should state clearly what you can do with them.

Although he mentions "public repositories" for data, he does not
address long-term preservation and usability issues.
