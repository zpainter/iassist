Melanie Wright and her doo-wop partners, Jen Green and Joanne Juhnke,
treated us to this year's song at the wrap up session. These fine
phrases should be set to the [tune of "My
Girl"](http://www.thomas-distributing.com/midi/my_girl.mid)

There was sunshine after weeks of rain When the IASSISTers to Ann Arbor
came Why have we come so far? What can drag us from the bar? Data (data)
talkin' 'bout data (data)

GIS, SDA and Atlas-TI Data lifecycles, and of course DDI in the Reading
Room we made some noise and ogled gorgeous jazz band boys and data
(data) always talkin' 'bout data (data)

Atkins talked about cyberinfrastructures new Make your report title long
enough, they'll just call it after you. Europe won't be left behind
Unless the Commission changes its mind about data (data) infrastructure
for data (data)

Oh those data librarians are accident prone With FEDORA and D-space,
we'll keep our digital objects at home. But not if Chuck has his way
[GET OVER IT!] Data professionals will save the day And the data
(data) we'll save the data (data) oooh oooh

"INSTRUMENTAL" BRIDGE

Well we honoured heroes of our own With lifetime awards for Ilona and
Tom It's turtle time for Wendy T After 9 years with the Treasury And
the data (data) always championing data (data)

The tornado raged blowing rain through the door Spyder rock and rolled,
and we all hit the floor We ponied, bumped and did the Twist Walter put
the Me back in IASSIST And the data (data) it's all about [ME] data
(data)

On Friday morning we talked about trust. Great discussions and talks
closing pictures a must. There'd better be a good pool hall When we
meet next year in Montreal Oh data (data) we'll be talkin' 'bout data
(data)
