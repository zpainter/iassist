DANS has published a video to promote storing and sharing data within
the research community. The video is available in Dutch and English, and
shown on the DANS Youtube channel. The title of the English video is
'Sharing data: good for science, good for
you':[http://youtu.be/HJbo-OAaJ1I
](http://youtu.be/HJbo-OAaJ1I)
"Scientific research produces data. The lifetime of these data varies
greatly. Stored on a hard disk or USB stick they are likely to be lost
in the near future together with the storage medium. Luckily, there is
another, more sustainable option, which benefits science.

In this video Dutch historian Martijn Kleppe (Erasmus University
Rotterdam) explains why he opened up his big photo database for other
researchers to use, and quantitative data analyst Manfred te Grotenhuis
(Radboud University Nijmegen) speaks about the treasures in data
archives that are waiting to be discovered by researchers.

Both scientists made use of the online archiving system EASY from DANS
(Data Archiving and Networked Services) in the Netherlands. As an
institute of KNAW and NWO, DANS promotes sustained access to digital
research data."

Feedback is welcome.
