As an early-career academic librarian, I was grateful and excited to attend the 49th Annual Conference of IASSIST. The conference took place in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada from May 28 – 31, 2024. This year, the conference theme was **Uncharted: Navigating the Future of Data**.

When planning my conference schedule, I found sessions on topics related to my expertise, aiming to gain a deeper understanding. I also found sessions on subjects I knew little about, looking to learn something new and broaden my knowledge. 

I entered the conference eager to learn with an excitement to meet new people and connect with others I’ve only met virtually. Engaging with these folks over the course of the conference made me feel more a part of the IASSIST community – there are people with all different levels of experience and areas of expertise, and everyone I interacted with was very warm, welcoming, and kind.

Throughout my time at the IASSIST Conference – from social events to formal presentations and everything in between – I pinpointed some recurring themes and key takeaways:

1. The significance of documenting and **learning about the past** in working toward a **more considerate future**. Understanding and contextualizing the past helps us learn from mistakes and glean insights from successes. With this knowledge, we can chart a more informed and compassionate course for the future. 
2. Emphasizing the value of **collaboration**, working together, and fostering a sense of **community**. By working across silos of understanding and fostering a welcoming environment, we can navigate the future together and find support and community along the way.
3. Encouraging **fun, creativity**, and thinking outside of the box when problem solving and coming up with ideas and solutions. Approaching the future with a spirit of fun and creativity makes the work more enjoyable and exciting and therefore more sustainable.

As the conference drew to a close, I felt refreshed, supported, and excited to apply the lessons I learned to my work, and I felt grateful for the opportunity to engage with and learn from others. 

Thank you to all the organizers and presenters who made this conference such a success. It’s safe to say that this was the best IASSIST ever!
