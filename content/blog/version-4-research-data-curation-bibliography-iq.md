Another reason to write for the IQ: you might get yourself into Charles
Bailey's prestigious bibliography, at

<http://digital-scholarship.org/rdcb/rdcb.htm>

I'm pleased to see no less than 7 IQ articles in the latest version. I
didn't count IASSISTers who published elsewhere but several of those
were in the list as well.
