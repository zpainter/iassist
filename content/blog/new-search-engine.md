[GovMine](http://www.govmine.com) is a new search engine that might
become useful in searches for data and statistics. Features that look
particularly promising:

-   categorized grouping of search results, including a category
    "Statistical Data" (try this [sample
    search](http://www.govmine.com/ts/10/search.do?qgeneral=heat+related+deaths+&submit.x=0&submit.y=0&submit=go&id=mine&fm=l&sc=&je=true&useraction=gm_upperSearch)).
    I didn't find this category frequently, but its appearance at all
    is tantalizing!
-   a search of .gov sites
-   relevance ranking (which they [make a
    point](http://www.govmine.com/ts/10/keyed/cramer-template/html/aboutOurResults.html)
    of being different from "popularity")
-   boolean search operators
-   "disambiguation" hints

An article ([Convera releases beta of gov't search
engine](http://apps1.infoworld.com/article/06/08/15/HNconverasearch_1.html))
says that it is an "engine designed to help U.S. government workers
find relevant information within the glut of data on the Internet" and
that it " uses similar pattern-recognition and semantic analysis that
Convera created for its database search software used by several U.S.
agencies." Another ([Convera debuts search portal for government
professionals](http://www.fcw.com/article95660-08-14-06-Web)) says that
the company that makes this tool "expects to launch a finished version
by the end of the fiscal year."

Thanks to Peggy Garvin, an independent information professional (aka
librarian) based in Washington, DC, who alerted me to this interesting
tool! ([GovMine on the Subway](http://freegovinfo.info/node/592))
