Sung to the tune of [Bryan Adam's "Summer of '69"](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFjjO_lhf9c) :

We all came to Vancouver<br />
in spring 2-0-1-1<br />
IASSISTers gather together<br />
this is gonna be fun!

Day long Admin meeting<br />
Ann skyped in for Constitutional change<br />
and we kept it all to the schedule<br />
Now that was really strange

oh, and when the Canucks won,<br />
the cheering seemed to last forever<br />
and that really set the scene<br />
for the best IASSIST ever<br />
These are the best days of IASISST

****

so many questions that you just can't answer<br />
when metadata isn't standardized<br />
in Japan/Europe/US and Australia<br />
we're building apps to wrangle DDI

We love a plenary speaker<br />
who gets there's no one in the room who won't<br />
understand bias and stochastic error<br />
'cuz Canuck politicians sure don't!

On the presidential 10K<br />
Bill proved that he could run forever<br />
As he takes up the reign<br />
Down the Hill Bill, it's now or never<br />
Yours will be the best days of IASSIST

*****

On Thursday our data warrior<br />
Chuck gave a plenary<br />
on the Main Street of infrastructure<br />
where will the social sciences be?

Lynda looks much taller on Twitter<br />
she and others kept us in the know<br />
"Moderately protected" is like "a little bit pregnant"<br />
Tweeters were the star of the show

This boat actually left the pier<br />
and the booze began to flow<br />
San and her two Walters hit the floor<br />
All the data people know that<br />
these are the best days of IASSIST

******
And so it's been decided<br />
Next year we'll be in DC<br />
then in Cologne the year after<br />
planned ahead for two out of three!

Next week when we look back<br />
Vancouver seemed to last forever<br />
And if we had the chance<br />
we know we'd always want to be there<br />
It was the best IASSIST of all

Many thanks to our talented musical director (and past President)
Melanie Wright, and everyone else who sang and listened; truly the best
IASSIST conference song ever!
