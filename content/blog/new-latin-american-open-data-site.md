> Poderomedia Foundation and PinLatam are launching
> [OpenDataLatinoamerica.org](http://www.opendatalatinoamerica.org/home/ "http://www.opendatalatinoamerica.org/"),
> a regional data repository to free data and use it on Hackathons and
> other activities by HacksHackers chapters and other organizations.
>
> We are doing this because the road to the future of news has been
> littered with lost datasets. A day or so after every hackathon and
> meeting where a group has come together to analyze, compare and
> understand a particular set of data, someone tries to remember where
> the successful files were stored. Too often, no one is certain.
> Therefore with Mariano Blejman we realized that we need a central
> repository where you can share the data that you have proved to be
> reliable: OpenData Latinoamerica, which we are leading as ICFJ Knight
> International Journalism Fellows.
>
> If you work in Latin America or Central America your organization can
> take part in OpenDataLatinoamerica.org. To apply, go to the website
> and answer a simple form agreeing to meet the standard criteria for
> open data. Once the application is approved, you will receive an
> account to start running and managing open data, becoming part of the
> community.
