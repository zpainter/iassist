Early registration for IASSIST 2011 ends a week from today, Thursday
March 31.  Fees will increase on April 1 so take advantage of the
reduced rate and register in the coming week.

<http://www.rdl.sfu.ca/IASSIST/index.php/Register/>

By registering early you save $50 for the full conference or $30 for a
single day ($40 and $20 at student rates).  The cancellation deadline
is April 22.
