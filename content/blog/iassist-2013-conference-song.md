Many thanks to Kate, Dan, and especially Melanie for this year's bit of
silliness. Thanks once again to Lynda Kellam for the video.

*(Sung to the tune of "[Lili Marlene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSMuTm649Hk)" If anyone wonders, the connection of the melody with Cologne is that the composer, [Norbert Schultze](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Schultze), once studied in Cologne.)*

It's 2013 IASSIST, and welcome to Cologne<br />
GESIS has endeavored to make us feel at home<br />
Data innovation was the theme<br />
And wifi problems made the scene<br />
We struggled to communicate<br />
Some tweets might turn up late

Monday was for meetings, workshops the next day<br />
Curation, access, OLAP, and R all made their play<br />
At the reception we all met<br />
The Kolsch we drank helped us to set<br />
The tone for what next came<br />
More walking in the rain

Wednesday was the day when it all really began<br />
Attendance at the talks at Maternushaus to plan<br />
The talks on RDM were cool<br />
As well as Services and Tools<br />
Kristin's duckie charmed the crew,<br />
Sam's rabbit joined in too

Wifi issues carried on, tweets were very few<br />
Posters and pecha kuchas were quite enough to do<br />
Data parachutes were opened, then<br />
We walked to Rheinterrassen<br />
With Spargel on the menu -<br />
'Asparagus' to you

Friday was the day when winding down began<br />
Next year's LAC began to talk about the plan<br />
This year's IASSIST was really great<br />
For next year's 40th you'll wait<br />
Toronto welcomes you<br />
With wifi access too.
