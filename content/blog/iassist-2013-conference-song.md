Many thanks to Kate, Dan, and especially Melanie for this year's bit of
silliness. Thanks once again to Lynda Kellam for the video.

*(Sung to the tune of "[Lili
Marlene](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZSMuTm649Hk)" If anyone
wonders, the connection of the melody with Cologne is that the composer,
[Norbert Schultze](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norbert_Schultze), once
studied in Cologne.)*

It's 2013 IASSIST, and welcome to Cologne
GESIS has endeavored to make us feel at home
Data innovation was the theme
And wifi problems made the scene
We struggled to communicate
Some tweets might turn up late

Monday was for meetings, workshops the next day
Curation, access, OLAP, and R all made their play
At the reception we all met
The Kolsch we drank helped us to set
The tone for what next came
More walking in the rain

Wednesday was the day when it all really began
Attendance at the talks at Maternushaus to plan
The talks on RDM were cool
As well as Services and Tools
Kristin's duckie charmed the crew,
Sam's rabbit joined in too

Wifi issues carried on, tweets were very few
Posters and pecha kuchas were quite enough to do
Data parachutes were opened, then
We walked to Rheinterrassen
With Spargel on the menu -
'Asparagus' to you

Friday was the day when winding down began
Next year's LAC began to talk about the plan
This year's IASSIST was really great
For next year's 40th you'll wait
Toronto welcomes you
With wifi access too.
