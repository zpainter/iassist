(Ann Arbor, MI) --- Representatives of 25 organizations that archive
scientific data today released a Call for Action urging the creation of
sustainable funding streams for domain repositories --- data archives
with close ties to scientific communities.

The document was developed after a meeting of data repositories across
the social and natural sciences June 24-25, 2013, in Ann Arbor. The
meeting was organized by the Inter-university Consortium for Political
and Social Research (ICPSR) at the University of Michigan and supported
by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation to discuss challenges facing domain
repositories, particularly in light of the February 2013 memorandum from
the U.S. Government's Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP)
requiring public access to federally funded data.

Domain repositories in the natural and social sciences are built upon
close relationships to the scientific communities that they service. By
leveraging in-depth knowledge of the subject matter, domain repositories
add value to the stored data beyond merely preserving the bits. As a
result, repositories contribute to scientific discovery while ensuring
that data curation methods keep pace as science evolves. "However, the
systems currently in place for funding repositories in the US are
inadequate for these tasks," the document states.

The Call for Action argues that "Domain repositories must be funded as
the essential piece of the US research infrastructure that they are,"
emphasizing the importance of:

•    Ensuring funding streams that are long-term, uninterrupted and
flexible
•    Creating systems that promote good scientific practice
•    Assuring equity in participation and access

The document expresses concerns regarding current and future funding
models in consideration of the OSTP rules. "The push toward open access,
while creating more equity of access for the community of users, creates
more of a burden for domain repositories because it narrows their
funding possibilities."

"We are memory institutions," ICPSR Director George Alter said. "One of
our missions is to ensure data will be available for a long time, yet
we're being funded by short-term grants. There is a mismatch between our
mission and the way we are funded. Widening access to data is a good
thing. Everyone agrees on that. But it has to be done in a way that
provides sustainable funding to the organizations that preserve and
distribute the data."

Repositories may require varied funding models, based on their
scientific domain, the document states. "But in every case, creating
sustainable funding streams will require the coordinated response of
multiple stakeholders in the scientific, archival, academic, funding,
and policy communities."

The statement is endorsed by 30 domain repository representatives. It

(ICPSR), based in Ann Arbor, MI, is the largest archive of behavioral
and social science research data in the world. It advances research by
acquiring, curating, preserving, and distributing original research
data. [www.icpsr.umich.edu](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu)
