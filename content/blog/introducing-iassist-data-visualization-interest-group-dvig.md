Hello fellow IASSISTer's

     With the upcoming 2013 Conference nearing, we thought it very
fitting to introduce you all to the newly created IASSIST Data
Visualization Interest Group. Formed over the winter and now spring of
2013, this group brings together over 46 IASSIST members from across the
world (literally across-the-world! check out the [**map of our
locations**](https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1vaGGyV_NUlLeME8YAIyjEcZPBnHQ1Cb62uO9J04#map:id=3)),
who are all interested in data visualization.  We hope to share a range
of skills and information around tools, best practice visualization, and
discuss innovative representations of data, statistics, and information.
Here is just a glimpse of our group's ***[tools
exposure](https://www.google.com/fusiontables/DataSource?docid=1UGpLXxGJp7uro3mfq5l2CcJHD8EokGb3OhstB68#chartnew:id=4)***.

    As research becomes more interdisciplinary and data and information
are more readily used and reused, core literacies surrounding the use
and understandability of data are required. Data Visualization supports
a means to make sense of data, through visual representation, and to
communicate ideas and information effectively. And, it is quickly
becoming a well-developed field not only in terms of the technology (in
the development of tools for analyzing and visualizing data), but also
as an established field of study and research discipline. As data and
information professionals, we are required to stay abreast of the latest
technologies, disciplines, methods and techniques, used for research in
this data-intensive and changing research landscape. Data Visualization,
with its many branches and techniques seeks to present data,
information, and statistics in new ways, ways that our researchers are
harnessing with the use of high-powered computers (and sometimes not so
high-powered) to perform analysis of data.  From conventional ways to
visualize and graph data -- such as tables, histograms, pie charts, and
bar and line graphs, to the often more complex network relationship
models and diagrams, cluster and burst analysis, and text analysis
charts; we see data visualization techniques at play more than ever. 

This group has set a core mission and charge to focus on promoting a
greater understanding of data visualization -- its creation, uses, and
importance in research, across disciplines.  Particular areas of focus
include, but are not limited to the following:

-   Enable opportunities for IASSIST members to learn and enhance their
    skills in this growing field;
-   Support a culture of best practice for data visualization
    techniques; creation, use, and curation;
-   Discussion of the relevant tools (programs, web tools, and software)
    for all kinds of data visualizations (spatial, temporal,
    categorical, multivariate, graphing, networks, animation, etc.);
-   Provide input and feedback on data visualization tools;
-   Capture examples of data visualization to emulate and avoid;
-   Explore opportunities for service development in libraries;
-   Be aware of and communicate to others the needs of researchers in
    this field;
-   Use of data visualization for allowing pre-analysis browsing of data
    content in repositories
-   Connect with communities of metadata developers and users (e.g., DDI
    Alliance) to gain better understanding of how metadata can enable
    better visualization, and how in turn visualization need might drive
    development of metadata standards.
-   And more!

Please join me in welcoming this new interest group, and we hope to
share and learn from you all at the upcoming conference! We are always
seeking input and to share ideas, please get in touch with us at
<iassist-dataviz@lists.carleton.edu> (either myself or another member
can add you to the group).

All the best, and Happy Easter!
