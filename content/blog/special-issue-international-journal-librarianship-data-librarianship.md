The special issue of the International Journal of Librarianship on Data
Librarianship I guest edited has been published. One feature in
particular that might be of interest to IASSISTers is an article in
which we interviewed a number of people who had prominent and
interesting careers in the field and asked them to share their thoughts
on how data services have changes over the course of their careers, as
well as advice for newbies.

Our interviewees include IASSIST President Tuomas J. Alaterä, as well as
Ann Green, Guangjing Li (China), Jian Qin, Wendy Watkins, and Lynn
Woolfrey. Hopefully it will help spread the IASSIST word to some
audiences we don't always reach! (Readership for this journal is
largely in Asia so far.)

Other articles and book reviews will also be of interest. Table of
contents:
