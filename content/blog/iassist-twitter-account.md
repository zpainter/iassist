Your friendly web editors have some news about the IASSIST web presence!

We're happy to report that we now have an official organizational
Twitter account:
[[http://twitter.com/iassistdata]{.s1}](http://twitter.com/iassistdata).
We hope to use this account to facilitate additional communication among
IASSIST members. 

Ways to view this Twitter account:

-   [[http://www.iassistdata.org/](http://www.iassistdata.org)]{.s1} -
    Does not require Twitter account
-   follow [<http://twitter.com/iassistdata>]{.s1} (and we'll follow
    you in return)
-   subscribe to the RSS feed of [<http://twitter.com/iassistdata>]{.s1}
    at <http://twitter.com/statuses/user_timeline/156331061.rss> - Does
    not require Twitter account

Each of these views will include posts by
[[http://twitter.com/iassistdata]{.s1}](http://twitter.com/iassistdata).
Please note, a post by
[[http://twitter.com/iassistdata]{.s1}](http://twitter.com/iassistdata)
can include 

-   original statements,
-   republishing posts from other Twitter users ("retweeting" or RTs
    because, yes, "retweet" is a very silly word) and
-   a reply to a specific Twitter user (an "@ reply" or a mention).

If you want to direct a post of your own to 

-   [viewers of
    [[http://www.iassistdata.org]{.s4}](http://www.iassistdata.org/),]{.s3}
-   followers of the
    [[http://twitter.com/iassistdata]{.s1}](http://twitter.com/iassistdata)
    account, and/or
-   subscribers to the
    [[http://twitter.com/iassistdata]{.s1}](http://twitter.com/iassistdata)
    RSS feed

then you should first follow
[[http://twitter.com/iassistdata]{.s1}](http://twitter.com/iassistdata)
and second include "@iassistdata" somewhere in the post. Don't worry
though - even if you forget the "@iassistdata", interesting posts
about data will very likely be RT'd by
[[http://twitter.com/iassistdata]{.s1}](http://twitter.com/iassistdata).

For any posts you wish to direct to
[[http://twitter.com/iassistdata]{.s1}](http://twitter.com/iassistdata)
that are about the upcoming conference, we request that you use the tag
"#iassist2011". An archive of these posts has already been set up at
[<http://twapperkeeper.com/hashtag/iassist2011>]{.s1}. An example of
what we mean would be

 "Hey, @iassistdata - know of anyone in need of a ride to the airport
at the end of #iassist2011?"
