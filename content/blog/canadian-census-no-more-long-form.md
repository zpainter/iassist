It appears that the Federal Government has decided to no longer have the
mandatory long form in the upcoming census (2011).  This is the list of
detailed questions filled out by about 20% of households.  It will be
replaced with another voluntary survey.   This has many potential
implications, especially for those using the census
'longitudinally'.   It may have some positive spinoffs, since the
replacement has a potentially larger sample size.   The disturbing part
is that we are not aware of any consultation with the research
community.

A good article is here.

I encourage those concerned to be vocal on this and pass it to
researchers.
