There is an interesting article by two of the creators of [Many
Eyes](http://services.alphaworks.ibm.com/manyeyes/home "Many Eyes").

[IBM's Many Eyes App After One
Month](http://www.readwriteweb.com/archives/ibm_many_eyes_after_one_month.php)
by Martin Wattenberg and Fernanda B. Viégas *Read/Write Web* (March 05,
2007).

While the initial examples they give of use of the site are, perhaps,
not very social science data intensive, the implications for use of
services like this (including [Swivel](http://www.swivel.com/ "Swivel")
and [Data 360](http://www.data360.org/ "Data 360")) may be profound. In
the authors words, they wanted...

> ...to create not social software, but societal-scale software.
>
> This represents a break from conventional visualization research.
> Traditionally, computer scientists concentrate on scaling in terms of
> data, making visualizations work for bigger and bigger databases. Our
> agenda is to scale the audience, not the data.
