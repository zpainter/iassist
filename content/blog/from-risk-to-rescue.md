IASSIST members work to discover, curate, make available, and keep data available. At the beginning of February, IASSIST Secretary **Lynda Kellam** started an internal Google document for her university to keep track of USA federal data that was disappearing and data rescue efforts.  While many were concerned and downloading data individually, efforts were often being duplicated while other data was disappearing and at risk of being lost.

IASSIST members were inquiring as were members of sister organizations including ***RDAP*** and the ***Data Curation Network***.  Lynda shared the document and soon others were adding to it. A meeting was called among various data organizations and leaders in past data rescue efforts to coordinate and soon the [Data Rescue Project <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://www.datarescueproject.org/about-data-rescue-project/) (DRP) was born.  Other organizations and individuals have joined the effort.

DRP aims to coordinate and communicate efforts to preserve access to public USA federal data that is currently at risk, and gather, curate and clean, catalog, and provide sustained access and distribution of data assets. They aim to ensure that the data captured has the appropriate documentation and metadata to enable long-term discoverability and preservation. Data and documentation are being added to [ICPSR's DataLumos <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://www.datalumos.org/datalumos/), a crowd-sourced repository for government data. Data has been rescued from many agencies including Center for Disease Control, the Department of Education, IMLS, FEMA, HUD, and SAMSHA. In addition, sites are nominated for the [End of Term Crawl 	<span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://eotarchive.org/).  

They have compiled an overview of ongoing efforts and helpful resources intended to help alleviate confusion and aid in the data rescue process:

- [Current efforts <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://www.datarescueproject.org/current-efforts/)
- [Resources <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://www.datarescueproject.org/resources/)
- [Data Rescue Tracker <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://www.datarescueproject.org/data-rescue-tracker/). Use to look up where data has been rescued and to nominate your efforts. It provides consolidated overviews of who is downloading which dataset from which government websites. 
  - If looking for a specific dataset, check out [Downloads <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://baserow.datarescueproject.org/public/grid/Nt_M6errAkVRIc3NZmdM8wcl74n9tFKaDLrr831kIn4) to see if it has been captured.
