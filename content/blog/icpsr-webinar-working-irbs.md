For those of you who follow the IASSIST Interest Group on Human Subjects
Review Committees and Privacy and Confidentiality in Research, you might
be interested in this webinar:

Amy Pienta and Kaye Marz of ICPSR's National Addiction and HIV Data
Archive Program will present a webinar on Nov. 28 titled "Navigating
Your IRB to Share Research Data."

They will share guidelines for working with Institutional Review Boards
to release data that may contain sensitive information, such as studies
on substance abuse. This session will be relevant both to older data
collections, which may not have been designed with sharing in mind, as
well as newer studies that may have more complex designs. Please join us
by reserving a seat at
