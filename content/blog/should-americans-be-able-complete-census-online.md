Using examples from Canada, Norway, and Australia, this report
recommends that the U.S Census Bureau provide an online data collection
option for all major household surveys that allow a paper response
including the Census and promote the Internet survey response option as
a secure, low-cost, and time-saving option.

> Given the increasingly digital world that we live in, most Americans
> will be surprised to learn that they will be unable to complete the
> 2010 Census online. In a new report, ITIF analyzes the decision made
> by the U.S. Census Bureau to eliminate the Internet response option
> and concludes that allowing respondents to submit their survey online
> would have saved the Census Bureau and taxpayers money. In addition,
> ITIF challenges the conventional wisdom that using the Internet for
> such an application poses a security risk, and outlines how other
> countries have met this challenge.
