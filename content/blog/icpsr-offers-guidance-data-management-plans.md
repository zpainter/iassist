In response to NSF's new requirement for data management plans in grant
applications, ICPSR recently rolled out new Web pages providing guidance
on how to create such plans effectively:
<http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/dmp/>.

The guidelines provide a detailed list of the possible elements of a
data management plan, developed through a scan of existing
recommendations for such plans from around the world. The site provides
some examples of data management plans as well as links to related
resources. Because some researchers may decide to deposit their research
data with ICPSR as part of a data management plan, the site also offers
information on how to deposit data with ICPSR.

We plan to update our guidelines regularly, and welcome any suggestions
or new examples via email at <web-support@icpsr.umich.edu>.

By the way, next week is ICPSR's Virtual Social Science Data Fair --
<http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/ICPSR/datafair/> -- and two
presentations on Monday, November 8, are devoted to data management.
Enrollment is still open, so please join us.
