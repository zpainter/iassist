Recently Kenya launched [Kenya Open Data](http://opendata.go.ke/), a
portal to national and sub-national data by and/or about the nation of
Kenya. The site runs on a tool called
[Socrata](http://www.socrata.com/) boasts a host of really nice features
including:

-   [rss for catalog & new
    visualizations](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11213479/openkenya_rss2.jpg)
-   [rss for specific datasets
    row-by-row](http://dl.dropbox.com/u/11213479/openkenya_rss1.jpg)
-   [links to the source data in visualization
    screens](http://opendata.go.ke/Counties/County-Urbanization-Laikipia/hvgr-c6jr) (link
    applies to items below was well)
-    widgets for embedding on websites
-    sort/hide columns; aggregation/disaggregation on data views
-    sharing of specific views via social media & email
-   a sign in option for data uploads

The site also contains links to [other data
platforms](http://opendata.go.ke/page/community-apps) such as [Google
Public Data
Explorer](http://www.google.com/publicdata/explore?ds=br3o0jm5iquuf_&ctype=b&strail=true&nselm=s&met_y=budget&fdim_y=BudgetType:dev&fdim_y=country:ke&scale_y=lin&ind_y=false&met_x=budget&fdim_x=BudgetType:rec&fdim_x=country:ke&scale_x=lin&ind_x=false&ccm=uni&met_s=budget&fdim_s=country:ke&idim=admin:phys:soc:other&ifdim=admin:parent:&tunit=Y&pit=1215381600000&iconSize=0.5&icfg=other:::2008%7Cphys:::2008%7Csoc:::2008&uniSize=0.034999999999999996).

The US site, <http://www.data.gov> also runs on Socrata. What's
interesting to me is how few of the Socrata features are used on
Data.gov as opposed to Kenya Open Data. Kenya's implementation is
really impressive.

I look forward to using this resource and am very glad that it's makes
so much data, especially sub-national data, readily available to me here
in the middle of the US!
