The European Social Survey (ESS) has won the prestigious Descartes
prize, awarded by the European Commission for "excellence in scientific
research". This is the first year that a social science project has won
this prize. (from [ESDS
News](http://www.esds.ac.uk/news/newsdetail.asp?ID=1488))IASSIST-ers who
attended the May 2005 conference in Edinburgh will remember the keynote
speech by Roger Jowell, from the Centre for Comparative Social Surveys,
City University, on 'The Need for Rigour and Accessibility in
Comparative Research.' Congratulations to Roger and his team for
winning the Descartes Prize, awarded annually to a transnational
research team which has achieved outstanding scientific or technological
results through collaborative research in any field of science,
including economics, social sciences and humanities.

 

The Norwegian Data Archive hosts the ESS data online via Nesstar.
Unusually, new data are made available to the research team and the
public simultaneously, at <http://www.europeansocialsurvey.org/>.

The European Social Survey (ESS) has won the prestigious Descartes
prize, awarded by the European Commission for "excellence in scientific
research". This is the first year that a social science project has won
this prize. The ESS is a biennial multi-country survey, measuring and
explaining trends in attitudes, beliefs and values across countries in
Europe and its close neighbours. It is funded by the European
Commission, the European Science Foundation, academic funding bodies and
National Science Foundations in each participating country, and is
designed and carried out to exceptionally high standards.
