The 44th annual conference of the International Association for Social
Science Information Services and Technology
([IASSIST](http://iassistdata.org/)) will be jointly held with the 52nd

Archives ([ACMLA-ACACC](https://acmla-acacc.ca/)) in Montréal, Québec,
Canada from May 29-June 1, 2018.

***Once Upon a Data Point: Sustaining our Data Storytellers***

In many ways, researchers are data storytellers: they create compelling
data-supported narratives for examining both historical and current
social phenomena and for facilitating social change and reconciliation.
We professionals who support these data storytellers play vital roles in
giving their data stories life. We assist our data storytellers in:

-   Discovering existing and collecting new data from which to craft the
    stories.
-   Analyzing and managing data to uncover the stories hiding within.
-   Visualizing data to offer vivid and meaningful illustrations to
    enhance the stories.
-   Teaching data literacy skills to their audiences so they can
    understand and critique the stories.
-   Curating, archiving, and sharing data so that the stories are not
    lost for future generations, and so new data storytellers may weave
    even more stories from the data.

And we conduct our own research to tell our own stories and to also
improve our support of other data storytellers.

We welcome submissions that tell diverse stories about our IASSIST and
ACMLA-ACACC communities' experiences, that offer conference attendees
suggestions of how they can implement or adapt lessons for their own
work, and that have wide-reaching appeal to our international attendees.
Although the positive outcomes are always something people want to hear,
there's also an appetite for learning about the things that didn't go
well, particularly any problems you faced and how others might avoid or
handle them.

So bring us your data comedies, tragedies, epics, horror stories,
mysteries, histories, thrillers, adventures, fables, fantasies, science
fiction, and even romances if you've got them! We look forward to
sharing, learning from, and adapting each other's stories.
