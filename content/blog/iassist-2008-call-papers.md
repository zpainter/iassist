***Technology of Data: Collection, Communication, Access and
Preservation*** The 34th International Association for Social Science
Information Services and Technology (IASSIST) annual conference will be
held at the Stanford University, Palo Alto, California, USA, May 27-30,
2008. This year's conference, Technology of Data: Collection,
Communication, Access and Preservation, examines the role of technology
and tools in various aspects of the data life cycle.

The theme of this conference addresses how technology can affect aspects
of data stewardship throughout the data lifecycle. The methods and media
by which data are collected, shared, analyzed and saved are
ever-changing, from punch cards and legal pads to online-surveys and tag
clouds. There has been an explosion of data sources and topics; vast
changes in compilation and dissemination methods; increasing awareness
about access and associated licensing and privacy issues; and growing
concern about the safeguarding and protection of valuable data resources
for future use. The 2008 conference is an opportunity to discuss the
role of technology -- past, present, and future -- in all of these
arenas. We seek submissions of papers, poster/demonstration sessions,
and panel sessions on the following topics:

-   Issues and techniques for preserving "old" data as well as
    information "born digital"
-   Methods, technology and questions surrounding data dissemination,
    including best practices and innovations
-   Archival and preservation challenges presented by new processes
-   Metadata

<!-- -->

-   Innovation in the use of data for teaching and research
-   The legal issues surrounding new technologies
-   Changes in resource discovery methods
-   Data services in virtual spaces
-   Providing services to users with different degrees of technical
    "savvy"
-   Tools and spaces for research collaboration

Papers on other topics related to the conference theme will also be
considered. The deadline for paper, session, and poster/demonstration
proposals is **December 17, 2007**. The Conference Program Committee
will send notification of the acceptance of proposals by **February 8,
2008**.

Individual presentation proposals and session proposals are welcome.
Proposals for complete sessions, typically a panel of three to four
presentations within a 90-minute session, should provide information on
the focus of the session, the organizer or moderator, and possible
participants. The session organizer will be responsible for securing
session participants. Organizers as well as panel participants are also
welcome to submit additional paper proposals but please note that
Conference Program Committee may need to limit the number of
presentations per person.

Proposals for papers, sessions, and poster/demonstrations should include
the proposed title and an abstract no longer than 200 words. Longer
abstracts will be returned to be shortened before being considered.
Please note that all presenters are required to register and pay the
registration fee for the conference. Registration for individual days
will be available.

Proposals can be submitted via email to: <iassist08@gmail.com>

A conference website with on-line submission form will be available
shortly. A separate call for workshops is also forthcoming.
