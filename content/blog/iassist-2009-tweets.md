We've created a Twitter feed for conference info, updates and
impressions. See it at http://twitter.com/IASSIST2009 or  there's a
link on the program page.

Before the conference, it will be mostly logistic and planning
information.  At the conference, IASSISTers will be tweeting about the
conference itself:  comments, suggestions, updates, and other
twitter-friendly information. We've got a few volunteer tweeters but
more are always welcome.

If you are interested in tweeting from the conference, contact Tuomas
Alatera who will set you up with a HootSuite account so you can help us
Twitter.  If there are any questions about content or other nontechnical
issues, contact San Cannon. (Don't have the our email addresses? Send a
note to iassist2009@congreszon.fi and it will find us!)

Let the Tweeting begin!
