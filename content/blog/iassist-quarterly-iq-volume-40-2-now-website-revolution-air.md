Welcome to the second issue of Volume 40 of the IASSIST Quarterly (IQ
40:2, 2016). We present three papers in this issue.

<http://iassistdata.org/iq/issue/40/2>

First, there are two papers on the Data Documentation Initiative that
have their own special introduction. I want to express my respect and
gratitude to Joachim Wackerow (GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social
Sciences). Joachim (Achim) and Mary Vardigan (University of Michigan)
have several times and for many years communicated to and advised the
readers of the IASSIST Quarterly on the continuing development of the
DDI. The metadata of data is central for the use and reuse of data, and
we have come a long way through the efforts of many people.    

The IASSIST 2016 conference in Bergen was a great success - I am told. I
was not able to attend but heard that the conference again was 'the
best ever'. I was also told that among the many interesting talks and
inputs at the conference Matthew Woollard's keynote speech on 'Data
Revolution' was high on the list. Good to have well informed informers!
Matthew Woollard is Director of the UK Data Archive at the University of
Essex. Here in the IASSIST Quarterly we bring you a transcript of his
talk. Woollard starts his talk on the data revolution with the
possibility of bringing to users access to data, rather than bringing
data to users. The data is in the 'cloud' - in the air - 'Revolution
in the air' to quote a Nobel laureate. We are not yet in the
post-revolutionary phase and many issues still need to be addressed.
Woollard argues that several data skills are in demand, like an
understanding of data management and of the many ethical issues.
Although he is not enthusiastic about the term 'Big Data', Woollard
naturally addresses the concept as these days we cannot talk about data
- and surely not about data revolution - without talking about Big Data.
I fully support his view that we should proceed with caution, so that we
are not simply replacing surveys where we 'ask more from fewer' with
big data that give us 'less from more'. The revolution gives us new
possibilities, and we will see more complex forms of research that will
challenge data skills and demand solutions at data service
institutions.  

Papers for the IASSIST Quarterly are always very welcome. We welcome
input from IASSIST conferences or other conferences and workshops, from
local presentations or papers especially written for the IQ. When you
are preparing a presentation, give a thought to turning your one-time
presentation into a lasting contribution. We permit authors 'deep
links' into the IQ as well as deposition of the paper in your local
repository. Chairing a conference session with the purpose of
aggregating and integrating papers for a special issue IQ is also much
appreciated as the information reaches many more people than the session
participants, and will be readily available on the IASSIST website at
<http://www.iassistdata.org>. 

Authors are very welcome to take a look at the instructions and layout:

Authors can also contact me via e-mail: <kbr@sam.sdu.dk>. Should you be
interested in compiling a special issue for the IQ as guest editor(s) I
will also be delighted to hear from you.
