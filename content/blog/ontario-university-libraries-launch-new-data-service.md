The following press release was posted to the IASSIST listserv by Bo
Wandschneider on 11 June: Ottawa: June 11, 2007 The Ontario Council of
University Libraries (OCUL) is pleased to announce the launch of the
Ontario Data Documentation, Extraction Service and Infrastructure
Initiative (ODESI), which will provide university researchers with
unprecedented access to a significant number of datasets in a web-based
data extraction system that will be delivered through the highly
successful Scholars' Portal model.

This infrastructure will be built on an international metadata standard
and will provide faculty and students with the tools for finding,
extracting and analyzing data from a variety of sources, including
Statistics Canada, polling data, as well as other national and
international data sources.

*ODESI *is jointly funded by the OCUL community and OntarioBuys. Total
project funding is $1.04 million over three years, with OntarioBuys
contributing $750,000.

Carleton University will be leading this project in close partnership
with the University of Guelph. "This will do for data, what Scholars'
Portal did for electronic journals", said Mike Ridley, Chief
Information Officer and Chief Librarian, University of Guelph. Margaret
Haines, Carleton University's Chief Librarian, believes "approaching
the creation of metadata in a collaborative way, based on international
standards, demonstrates a responsible, effective and efficient use of
resources".

In test cases, first year students found an ODESI prototype "fun to
use" and were able to analyze data during a three-hour workshop*.*
This task would have taken several weeks to accomplish using traditional
tools and methods and would not likely have been undertaken by first
year students.

The service will expose undergraduates to the research enterprise at an
early stage in their careers and is important in developing numeracy
skills. Researchers working with opinion polls will be able search
across hundreds of datasets and collections to see trends and historical
patterns over time. To date such comparative analysis has been lacking
due to the enormous amount of time and labour needed to search and
locate data manually.**

*ODESI* will be housed at Scholars' Portal, located at the University
of Toronto, and will support its goal of providing access for networked
scholars to a set of tools to aid both teaching and research. The
*ODESI* project brings data, an extremely important research resource,
to the desktops of scholars and students.

Bo Wandschneider, Associate Director of Computing and Communications at
the University of Guelph and interim project manager, says: "We are
absolutely thrilled to get this funding. It will be an exciting time in
Canada as this project leverages nicely with other national and
international initiatives." For more information, contact Bo
