Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR)
website has a new section devoted to [Data Management and
Curation](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/datamanagement/index.html),
which provides a general guide on research data quality, preservation,
access, confidentiality, and citation, and also explains how ICPSR, as a
social science research data archive, is working hard to address all
these issues. There is also a [Tools & Services
section](http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/content/datamanagement/tools.html)
compiling recommended applications that could help researchers deal with
data confidentiality, restricted-use data, data processing, and
dissemination.

In January 2014, ACRL/Numeric and Spatial Data Interest Group invited
ICPSR's Director of Curation Services, Jared Lyle, to offer a webinar
for data librarians on the subject of social science data management and
curation. The
[slides](http://connect.ala.org/file-manager/download/group/85286/Webinar%20Slides/20140113_acrl_lyle.pptx)
and [recording of the webinar](http://youtu.be/V2GyfCjzCkA) are
available for viewing now.
