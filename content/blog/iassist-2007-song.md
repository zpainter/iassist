Here it is: music by Leonard Cohen, lyrics by Melanie Wright and
company. Now you can sing along to the YouTube video.

**Open Data**

We made our way to Montreal Where everybody knows f&*% all And no
one's gonna tell you "see you later." Admin committee steaming hot
Went on and on 'til we asked what Does all this have to do with Open
Data?

Chorus: Open Data, Open Data, IASSISTERs / here to cheer / Open Data.

Tuesdays workshops best ones yet One through six were quite a set But
what were they about? They gave us drinks, though. Reception at the
Faculty Manse Where Ernie bravely took the chance To welcome us in
French(?) -- at least we think so.

Chorus

Arofan called users "Chimps" "Gastrointestinal issues" crimped The
style of more than Chuck -- a nasty feeling. Thin walls meant we got two
talks for one (that Windows Update's still not done) Evacuate! Watch
out! Here comes the ceiling!

Chorus

Alison's lifetime achievement praised And fundamental issues raised
About the ddi (fermez la bouche, man) Posters great, with lots to click
Two pool tables, one cue stick If you're too full to finish, Meredith
can!

Chorus

Thursday we heard from Denise Being a statistician means You never, ever
have to say you're certain. At the business lunch, Jen gave us pie, And
"Gimmee Gimmee" Karsten cried But was he truly desperate, or just
flirting?

Chorus

The Banquet barge was full of class Our excess hot air steamed the glass
But at least we left the pier and even tacked, too Dancing wild we
regained our youth Turkey Action taught this truth: You don't steal
Wendy's punchline, or she'll whack you!

Chorus

Now it's time to say goodbye With many a tired and teary eye We're
having so much fun, it's hard to halt, so We'll not say bye, but au
revoir No matter if you're near or far We'll see you all next year, in
Palo Alto!

Chorus
