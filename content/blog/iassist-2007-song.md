Here it is: music by Leonard Cohen, lyrics by Melanie Wright and company. Now you can sing along to the YouTube video.

**Open Data**

We made our way to Montreal<br />
Where everybody knows f&*% all<br />
And no one's gonna tell you "see you later."<br />
Admin committee steaming hot<br />
Went on and on 'til we asked what<br />
Does all this have to do with Open Data?

Chorus: Open Data, Open Data,<br />
IASSISTERs / here to cheer / Open Data.

Tuesdays workshops best ones yet<br />
One through six were quite a set<br />
But what were they about? They gave us drinks, though.<br />
Reception at the Faculty Manse<br />
Where Ernie bravely took the chance<br />
To welcome us in French(?) – at least we think so.<br />

Chorus

Arofan called users "Chimps"<br />
"Gastrointestinal issues" crimped<br />
The style of more than Chuck – a nasty feeling.<br />
Thin walls meant we got two talks for one<br />
(that Windows Update's still not done)<br />
Evacuate! Watch out! Here comes the ceiling!

Chorus

Alison's lifetime achievement praised<br />
And fundamental issues raised<br />
About the ddi (fermez la bouche, man)<br />
Posters great, with lots to click<br />
Two pool tables, one cue stick<br />
If you're too full to finish, Meredith can!

Chorus

Thursday we heard from Denise<br />
Being a statistician means<br />
You never, ever have to say you're certain.<br />
At the business lunch, Jen gave us pie,<br />
And "Gimmee Gimmee" Karsten cried<br />
But was he truly desperate, or just flirting?

Chorus

The Banquet barge was full of class<br />
Our excess hot air steamed the glass<br />
But at least we left the pier and even tacked, too<br />
Dancing wild we regained our youth<br />
Turkey Action taught this truth:<br />
You don't steal Wendy's punchline, or she'll whack you!

Chorus

Now it's time to say goodbye<br />
With many a tired and teary eye<br />
We're having so much fun, it's hard to halt, so<br />
We'll not say bye, but au revoir<br />
No matter if you're near or far<br />
We'll see you all next year, in Palo Alto!

Chorus
