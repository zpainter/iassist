stolen from the VA "was stored in a format that could make it difficult
for thieves to use, according to an internal VA memo."

> In the May 5 memo, VA privacy officer Mark Whitney wrote that the
> critical data "may not be easily accessible" because most of it --
> including names, birth dates and Social Security numbers -- was
> stored in a specialized, standard format used for data manipulation
> and statistical analysis.
