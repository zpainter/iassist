The IASSIST Quarterly (IQ Vol. 30 issue 2 - 2006) is now available on
the web:

<http://iassistdata.org/publications/iq/iqvol30.html>

Winter came late in Denmark, but suddenly the situation was normal: snow
came and traffic stopped. And now 14 days after spring was here in
March. I sat outside in the sun reading articles. Still it's more
difficult to write articles outside, we are waiting for the improvements
of the computer screens. However, some people have stayed inside to
write articles for the IASSIST Quarterly. They are presented below.

The first article "Microdata Information System - MISSY" is written by
Andrea Janssen and Jeanette Bohr from Centre for Survey Research and
Methodology, ZUMA at Mannheim in Germany. The MISSY was presented at the
session on "Effective Strategies for Metadata Management" by Andrea
Janssen, Jeanette Bohr, and Joachim Wackerow at the IASSIST conference
in April 2006 in Ann Arbor. The data behind or in the system is the
German microcensus for 1995 and 1997 containing a sample of one percent
of all German households. The microcensus has been carried out since
1957, and parts of the microcensus are available for research. The
researchers need extensive metadata on both the study and variable
level, e.g. the microcensus uses complicated classifications of
professions, sectors, and household arrangements. The system is based on
the standard from the Data Documentation Initiative and documentation
includes general information such as questionnaire, codebooks,
interviewer guides, frequencies and also some tips and recommendations
on use of the data. MISSY is a German system, in German language, and
for researchers in Germany. However, all are free to gain from the
experiences presented in the article.

This second article was also presented at the IASSIST 2006 conference in
Ann Arbor, Michigan, at the session "Innovations in Data
Dissemination". The title of the article is "User-Centered Design and
Innovation in the Sociometrics Social Science Electronic Data Library
(SSEDL)". The authors Josefina J. Card, Tamara Kuhn, and Thomas Wells
are all at Sociometrics Corporation. The article describes the
Sociometrics Data Archives SSEDL (the Social Science Electronic Data
Library) as being a rich source of data for those in the public health,
medical, nursing, social work, and social science professions. Datasets
comes with several description files for SAS and SPSS. This is the
"product package". Purchasers can acquire data on CD-ROM or download
from a web site and downloading have had high rise in usage. In order to
help users identify relevant datasets Sociometics have launched a topic
based drill down system showing "areas of richness" which helps users
identify and reach datasets and variables and the documentation behind.

The last pages are the "Overview of a Proposed Standard for the
Scholarly Citation of Quantitative Data" by Micah Altman and Gary King.
This is an extended abstract summarizing a proposed standard for
citation. This was presented at the IASSIST 2006 conference in Ann Arbor
at the session "New Standards in Statistics and Data Citations" by
Micah Altman, Harvard University. Micah Altman is Associate Director,
Harvard-MIT Data Center & Senior Research Scientist , Institute for
Quantitative Social Science; Harvard University. Gary King is David
Florence Professor of Government, Institute for Quantitative Social
Science, Harvard University. The authors mention that as a minimum
citations should include author(s), date of publishing the data set, and
the data set title. These fields have been discussed earlier during the
last close to 50 years of documentation of data sets; and the fields are
not so unambiguous now not to be discussed further. For instance a great
many people can be called "authors" in the production of a data set,
and the same data set can have several other relevant dates attached
besides "publishing date". The authors recommend using the DDI
elements but their main business is to propose some novel fields that
are directly linked to the use of modern technology. First of all a
Unique Global Identifier. The authors mention a naming resolution
service and that brings to mind the technology of the internet with name
servers for looking up the correct IP, however in this context more than
one copy of the dataset can exist at different physical locations.
Secondly technology is applied in adding a Universal Numeric
Fingerprint. This should guarantee that the data set has not been
changed even though the data set might exist in different software. This
should probably apply to the documentation as well.

The IASSIST is always open at the website

presentations, discussion input, etc. Contact the editor via e-mail:
