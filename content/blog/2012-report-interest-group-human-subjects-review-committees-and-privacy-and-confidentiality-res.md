For those of you exploring issues of human subjects, privacy and confidentiality, this group may be of interest.  In the coming year we hope to put together some resources and guides for those working with confidential data or human subjects related work.  Please contact libbie@ucla.edu if you are "interested"!

**Interest Group on Human Subjects Review Committees and Privacy and Confidentiality in Research**
:   This group will focus on issues related to conducting research using
    human subjects in the social sciences. Particular areas of focus and
    discussion will include, but are not limited to the following:
:   **·** The role and function of the human subjects review board as
    social science research enters the digital age.
    **·** The human subject review influences and effects on data
    management, dissemination, curation and preservation practices.
    **·** Issues related to protection of human subjects laws and
    policies established in [IASSIST]{.il} member countries.
    **·** Issues related to privacy and confidentiality of human
    subjects in research.
:   We will seek out and take advantage of opportunities for education,
    outreach and advocacy on subjects related to human subjects review
    committees, including proposing sessions with rele vant
    presentations at [IASSIST]{.il} conferences and creating web based
    resources and tools for members.
:   **2011-2012 Chair:** *Libbie Stephenson, <libbie@ucla.edu>*

**2011-2012 report:**  The Interest group has been largely inactive this
past year; however two efforts are worthy of mention.  In the U.S. the
Department of Health and Human Services circulated an Advanced Notice of
Proposed Rulemaking (ANPRM): Human Subjects Research and Reducing
Burden, Delay and Ambiguity for Investigators.  The research community
was invited to comment.  Given time constraints it was decided that
[IASSIST]{.il} (via email discussion with [IASSIST]{.il} AC members)
would not make a formal statement; however individual members of
[IASSIST]{.il} were encouraged to submit comments.  A link to the
details on this effort is here:
<http://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/anprm2011page.html> and contains
directions to individual comments. The Interest Group would like to
thank George Alter (DataPASS, ICPSR) Micah Altman (MIT) and Joann Juhnke
for their support and collaboration on responses to this ANPRM.

A second activity involved a U.S. Office of Science and Technology
Request for Information: Public Access to Digital Data Resulting from
Federally Funded Scientific Research.  This RFI was broad in scope
however, several of the questions were of a human subjects nature and
again, [IASSIST]{.il} members were encouraged to submit responses and a
number did so. Details on the RFI can be found here:
<https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2011/12/23/2011-32947/request-for-information-public-access-to-digital-data-resulting-from-federally-funded-scientific>. 
The Interest Group would like to thank George Alter (DataPASS, ICPSR)
Micah Altman (MIT) for their support and collaboration on responses to
this RFI.

The Interest Group would like to continue for another year and unless
there is someone else who would like to become Chair, the current Chair
is willing to continue in this role.  The Interest Group would welcome
suggestions for further activities from the AC if any are forthcoming.

Respectfully submitted,
Libbie Stephenson, Chair
