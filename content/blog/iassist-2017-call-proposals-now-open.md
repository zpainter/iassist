### IASSIST 2017 CALL FOR PROPOSALS

#### Data in the Middle: The common language of research

The 43rd annual conference of the International Association for Social
Science Information Services and Technology (IASSIST) will be held in
Lawrence, Kansas from May 23-26, 2017. #iassist17

Many issues around data (sources, strategies, and tools) are similar
across disciplines. While IASSIST has its roots in social science data,
it has also welcomed discussions over the years of other disciplines'
issues as they relate to data, data management, and support of users. So
again this year, in line with this tradition, we are arranging a
conference that will benefit those who support researchers across all
disciplines: social sciences, health and natural sciences, and
humanities. Please join the international data community in Lawrence,
KS, "in the middle" of the U.S., for insights and discussion on how
data in all disciplines are found, shared, used, and managed. Join us
and draw inspiration from this diverse gathering! 

We welcome submissions for papers, presentations, panels, posters, and
pecha kuchas.

The full Call for Proposals, along with the link to the submission form,
can be accessed on the conference website here:
