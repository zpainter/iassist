Until next year of course!

This year's conference is done and Anastassia, Susan, and the wonderful
Local arrangement folks at McGill are probably breathing a sigh of
relief! Lots of informations was presented and some of it was absorbed!
More will likely be reviewed over coming weeks preceded by the usual
"Now I **know** I saw a presentation about this at IASSIST...."

If you were one of those fine presenters, please don't forget to submit
a paper to the IQ
([instructions](http://www.iassistdata.org/publications/iq/ "IQ submission instructions")
for doing so are on the [IASSIST
website](http://www.iassistdata.org "IASSIST web site")). Also, we want
to make sure that your presentation itself is captured for prosperity so
please check with Lisa Neidert (lisan at umich.edu) to make sure we have
a copy.

Hopefully, we'll have more wrap up materials being posted soon.... if
I can convince Bo to cough up some photos and coerce Melanie to share
the song lyrics. Of course, Harrison Decker has really captured the Web
2.0 spirit and posted a [video of the
performance](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XjX2ePg_3FY "IASSIST07 closing song")
on YouTube!

For the rest, you'll have to rely on fond memories and the promises
that next year's conference will again be the best IASSIST ever! I'll
be posting planning info here as the months progress so stay tuned. [Let
me know](mailto:sandra.a.cannon@frb.gov "Email to program chair") if you
want to be part of the planning committee. Otherwise, think about the
possibilities for:
