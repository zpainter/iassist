"Digital Scholarship has released the Research Data Curation
Bibliography. It includes over 100 selected English-language articles
and technical reports that are useful in understanding the curation of
digital research data in academic and other research institutions."

"Most sources have been published from 2000 through 2011; however, a
limited number of earlier key sources are also included."

[View the Data Curation
Bibliography.](http://digital-scholarship.org/rdcb/rdcb.htm)

A number of IASSIST members are cited in the bibliography. Digital
Scholarship (aka Charles Bailey) compiles mainstream LIS bibliographies
on topics that have hit the mainstream of Library and Information
Science. This is their first bibliography on the topic of data curation,
surely a high water mark.
