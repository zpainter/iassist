Hi folks!  A lovely gift for your reading pleasure over the holidays, we
present two, yes, TWO issues of the IASSIST Quarterly.  The first is the
double issue, 38(4)/39(1) with guest editors, Joachim Wacherow of GESIS
-- Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences in Germany and Mary
Vardigan of ICPSR at the University of Michigan, USA.  This issue
focuses on the Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) and how it makes
meta-analysis possible.  The second issue is 39(2), and is all about
data:  avoiding statistical disclosure, using data, and improving
digital preservation.  Although we usually post the full text of the
Editor's Notes in the blog post, it seems lengthy to do that for both
issues.  You will find them, though, on the web site: the [Editor's
Notes for the double
issue](http://www.iassistdata.org/iq/issue/38/4 "Editor's Notes for Issue 38(4)/39(1)"),
and the [Editor's Notes for issue
39(2)](http://www.iassistdata.org/iq/editor%E2%80%99s-notes-avoiding-disclosure-using-data-and-improving-digital-preservation "Editor's Notes for Issue 39(2)").
