**Editor's Notes**

**Being international - and proud of it!**

IASSIST is proud of being international. These days some us of find it
important to emphasize how international collaboration has improved and
made our lives more efficient. In the small but
around-the-globe-reaching world of IASSIST, many national data archives
have come into existence as well as continuing their development,
through friendly international support and spreading of knowledge and
good practices among IASSISTers. So let us cherish the 'International'
in IASSIST. We are proud of the lead 'I' for 'International' in the
IASSIST acronym and have no intention of changing that to 'N' for
'National'. It is also my impression that data archives all over the
world simply don't have the facilities for storing 'alternative
facts' as they are shy of all kinds of documentation.

Welcome to the third issue of Volume 40 of the IASSIST Quarterly (IQ
40:3, 2016). Four papers with authors from three continents are
presented in this issue. The paper 'Demonstrating Repository
Trustworthiness through the Data Seal of Approval' is a summary of a
panel session at the IASSIST 2015 conference in Minneapolis with panel
members Stuart Macdonald, Ingrid Dillo, Sophia Lafferty-Hess, Lynn
Woolfrey, and Mary Vardigan. The paper has an introduction from DANS in
the Netherlands where the Data Seal of Approval (DSA) originated. Cases
from the US and South Africa are presented and the future of the DSA
including possible harmonization with other systems is discussed. DSA
certifications are basically consumer guidance, clearly assisting all
the involved parties. Depositors and funding bodies will be assured that
data are reliably stored, researchers can reliably access the data
repositories, and repositories are supported in their work of archiving
and distribution of data.

The second article brings us to the actual use of data. From the UK Data
Service, Rebecca Parsons and Scott Summers in 'The Role of Case Studies
in Effective Data Sharing, Reuse and Impact' take us into positive
narratives around secondary data. The background is that although the
publishing of data is now recognised by funders, the authors find that
'showcasing' brings motivation for data sharing and reuse as well as
improving the quality of data and documentation. The impact of case
studies is all-sided and research, depositing data, and the brand
recognition of the UK Data Service are among the areas investigated. The
future is likely to include new case studies developed for use in
teaching in schools, with easy linking to datasets, as well as for
researchers being assisted to build their own portfolios. The appendix
presents case studies on research and impact.

In the third article, we are situated in data creation. Muhammad F.
Bhuiyan and Paula Lackie from Carleton College in Minnesota write on
'Mitigating Survey Fraud and Human Error: Lessons Learned from A Low
Budget Village Census in Bangladesh'. As the 'fraud' term implies,
they are looking into the problem of data creators being too creative,
but more importantly they are investigating the essential area of data
quality. The authors explain how selected technological assets like the
use of geographic information systems (GIS) and audio-capturing smart
pens improved data quality. The use of these tools is exemplified
through many scenarios described in the paper. Furthermore, a procedure
of daily monitoring and fast transcription lead to quick surveyor
re-training and dismissal of others, thus minimising data errors. For
those interested in false data and its detection, the introduction in
particular has valuable references to literature.

In the last paper the difficult task of handling images is addressed in
'Image Management as a Data Service' by Berenica Vejvoda, K. Jane
Burpee, and Paula Lackie. Vejvoda and Burpee work at McGill University
in Montreal. You have already met Lackie from Carleton College in
relation to the third paper above. The 'images' in the article are
digital images, and the authors suggest that the knowledge of digital
data services across the 'research data lifecycle' also benefits the
management of digital images. Digital images are numerical data, and the
article compares the data, metadata, and paradata of a survey respondent
to the information on a digital image. Considerations from normal data
concerning system formats and storage space also apply to management of
images. In the last section the paper introduces copyright issues that
are complicated, to say the least. Just as reuse of normal data can have
ethical angles, it is even more apparent that images can have
complicated issues of privacy and confidentiality.

Papers for the IASSIST Quarterly are always very welcome. We welcome
input from IASSIST conferences or other conferences and workshops, from
local presentations or papers especially written for the IQ. When you
are preparing a presentation, give a thought to turning your one-time
presentation into a lasting contribution. We permit authors 'deep
links' into the IQ as well as deposition of the paper in your local
repository. Chairing a conference session with the purpose of
aggregating and integrating papers for a special issue IQ is also much
appreciated as the information reaches many more people than the session
participants, and will be readily available on the IASSIST website at
http://www.iassistd ata.org.

Authors are very welcome to take a look at the instructions and layout:

Authors can also contact me via e-mail: kbr@sam.sdu.dk. Should you be
interested in compiling a special issue for the IQ as guest editor(s) I
will also be delighted to hear from you.
