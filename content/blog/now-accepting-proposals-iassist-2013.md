As announced previously, the theme of this year's conference is **Data
Innovation: Increasing Accessibility, Visibility and Sustainability**

This theme reflects recent efforts across the globe by the largest
government agencies down to the smaller independent research units to
make data (be it survey, administrative, geospatial, or scientific) more
open, accessible and understandable for all.

With an ever-increasing availability of new technologies offering
unparalleled opportunities to sustainably deliver, share, model and
visualize data, we anticipate that there is much to share with and much
to learn from one another.  Interdisciplinarity is a large part of where
innovation comes from, and we hope to receive submissions from those in
the social sciences, humanities, sciences, and computer science fields.

We welcome submissions on the theme outlined above, and encourage
conference participants to propose papers and sessions that would be of
interest to a diverse audience. In order to make session formation and
scheduling more streamlined, we have created three distinct tracks.  If
you are not sure where your submission fits, or feel that it fits into
more than one track, that's perfectly fine. Please do still make your
submission, and if accepted, we will find an appropriate fit.

Online submission forms and guidelines for BOTH conference content and
workshops are be found here:
<http://www.iassist2013.org/conference/calls/>

NOTE: The **top** of the page is for sessions/papers/posters/round
tables/pecha kuchas the **bottom** is for workshops -- please note that
the submission forms are completely separate.

All submissions are **due** by December 5, 2012.  Notification of
**acceptance** will be made by February 5, 2012
