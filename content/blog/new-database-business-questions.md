The MIT [Dewey Research Advisor](http://libraries.mit.edu/dra) is a
database of business and economic FAQs and answers. The focus is
definitely business and economics, but for those areas it is a useful
and easy to use resource for finding quick answers to common data
(particularly aggregate data and time series data) and statistical
reference questions.
