Tiffani Conner, Paula Lackie and Jen Darragh are working on the handouts
for an ALA poster session and have found that defining "data" and
"data librarian" clearly, in a concise manner, for a non-data audience
is really hard. In addition, some of the sources they consulted (the
Online Dictionary of Library and Information Science - ODLIS , Oxford
English Dictionary ) were not adequate (ODLIS has data, data set, social
science data set but the definitions are not that great). They also
looked at Wikipedia, and there is nothing for data librarian. This
raises a question: would IASSISTers be interested in crafting a
definition of "Data Librarian" for Wikipedia? We can start by
collecting comments in the blog, and then move it over to Wikipedia once
we have a full definition. We've crafted a working definition (keep in
mind that we are speaking to a traditional library audience) as a place
to start. **Data librarianship is an ad hoc term. In essence, it is the
application of traditional librarianship principles and practices to
data resources. Data librarianship involves one or more of the
following; acquisition (collection development), organization
(cataloging and metadata), and the implementation of appropriate user
services**
