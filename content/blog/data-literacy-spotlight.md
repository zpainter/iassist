I am very pleased to announce that the special double issue of the
IASSIST Quarterly ([IQ issues Vol. 28-2 and
28-3](http://www.iassistdata.org/publications/iq/iqvol28.html)) on
"data literacy" is now available on the web.

Thanks to the special guest editors and the authors there are
contributions in the form of eight articles on the subject of "data
literacy". This is a subject that has the focus of many IASSIST efforts
- among them themes and sessions at conferences. Furthermore is the
enhancement of data literacy the daily work of many IASSIST members.
These members are making a great contribution to the building of
competences for evaluation of information.

The big editorial work has been carried out by two very active
chairpersons: Louise Corti from the UK Data Archive at the University of
Essex and Wendy Watkins from the Library Data Centre at the Carleton
University Library.

The printed version of this special double issue will shortly be mailed
out in paper form to the IASSIST membership.
