Join us in 2025 for a series of online workshops showcasing tools and strategies for qualitative data analysis (QDA). Hosted by the IASSIST Professional Development Committee and the Qualitative Social Science & Humanities Data Interest Group (QSSHDIG), these monthly webinars will explore a range of technologies designed to support qualitative research -- starting this March!

## Why Attend? 

With so many tools available for analyzing qualitative data, these workshops will offer practical insights by addressing key comparative questions about each tool or strategy. Tool focused presentations will include information about data formats compatible with the tool, as well as how the data is stored, shared and exported. Presenters will also discuss collaboration capabilities and unique features of the tool. 

In addition to the tool-focused workshops, we’ll also have presentations on appropriate uses of AI in qualitative data analysis, choosing a qualitative analysis software, and an approach to thematic analysis using AI. These workshops provide additional insight into the process of developing an analysis plan and will support attendees who may be receiving questions about the use of AI in qualitative research.
