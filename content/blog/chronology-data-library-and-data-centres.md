A few days ago I asked on [the IASSIST mailing
list](https://iassistdata.org/about/iasst-l.html "IASSIST Mailing List")
for some help in order to find out dates of creation of data libraries,
data centres and such services. It was overwhelming to receive answers
from colleagues from everywhere with dates and some other useful
information about the establishment of local data support and national
services.

There is a wealth of information in this community around these issues
and with the increasing importance of data services we need to make sure
we collect and make this information accessible. After all, our data
obsession comes with the trade. ; )

There were many colleagues that asked for all the information to be
compiled and shared. Thus I have prepared an initial google sheet titled
"[Chronology of data libraries and data
services](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1qmC_z50UDHh3Jwdlu6wGrtz1xjdfumBaad6P6cUpBdY/edit?usp=sharing "Chronology of data libraries and data centres")"
with the information from all responses.

I have added a few extra fields such as country or type of service but
am sure there would be many others that could be interesting. The list
is by no means complete or perfect so I ask again for help from
colleagues to add or edit (you will need to request edit access for
this).

I also wonder whether other information of IASSIST membership could be
merged to construct an even more powerful dataset. All comments,
suggestions and volunteering is welcome.
