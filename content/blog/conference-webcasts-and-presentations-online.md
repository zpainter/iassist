A week has passed since IASSIST 2009. I hope most of you have made it
safely back home by now - and are ready to refresh the memories by
watching the [conference webcasts and viewing
presentations](http://www.fsd.uta.fi/iassist2009/program.html). Webcasts
of all three plenaries and Thursday and Friday's concurrent sessions in
the Small Auditorium are now available. We didn't have cameras
available during the Wednesday sessions, so no videos of these
presentations, sorry! But most of the presentations are already online -
a few are still missing either because we didn't have them or we are
waiting for an updated version. Please send in any missing presentations
or email me if there are mistakes that should be corrected!
