[Welcome Hadley, Winston,
and Garrett!](http://blog.rstudio.org/2012/08/20/welcome-hadley-winston-and-garrett/)

RStudio's mission from the beginning has been to create powerful tools
that support the practices and techniques required for creating
trustworthy, high quality analysis. For many years [Hadley
Wickham](http://had.co.nz/ "Hadley Wickham") has been teaching and
working on his own set of tools for R with many of the same core goals.
We've been collaborating quite a bit with Hadley over the past couple of
years and today we're excited to announce that Hadley, Winston Chang,
and Garrett Grolemund are joining RStudio so we can continue to work
together much more closely.

You probably know Hadley from his work
on [ggplot2](http://had.co.nz/ggplot2/ "ggplot2"), [plyr](http://plyr.had.co.nz/ "plyr"),
and many other packages. Garrett was a PhD student of Hadley's at Rice,
and you might also know him from
the [lubridate](http://www.r-statistics.com/2012/03/do-more-with-dates-and-times-in-r-with-lubridate-1-1-0/ "lubridate") package,
which makes dealing with dates and time easier; he's also been working
on new tools for visualisation and new ways of thinking about the
process of data analysis. Winston has been working full-time on ggplot2
for the last couple of months, squashing many bugs and repaying a lot of
the technical debt that's accumulated over the years. Winston's also
writing an [R Graphics
Cookbook](http://www.amazon.com/R-Graphics-Cookbook-Winston-Chang/dp/1449316956 "R Graphics Cookbook") for
O'Reilly that should be available in the near future.

What does this mean for RStudio? We'll of course continue developing
open-source software like the RStudio IDE, ggplot2, and plyr (among many
other projects). One of Hadley's core focuses at RStudio will also be
expanding our mission to include education, which we plan to offer in a
variety of formats ranging from in-person training to some innovative
new online courses. We'll also be working on hosted services
(like [RPubs](http://rpubs.com/ "RPubs")) as well as some new products
that address the challenges of deploying R within larger organizations.

We're all excited to begin this next phase of work together and will
have lots more details to announce later this fall!
