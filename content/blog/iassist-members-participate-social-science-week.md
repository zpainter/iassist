The ESRC Social Science Week was celebrated from June 20-24, 2005 in the
UK. As part of the event, several specialists were invited to write
articles about how the Internet has changed the ways in which research
is done in the social sciences.

Three IASSIST members were the contributing authors on Wednesday, June
22nd, which had a focus on access to data. Alastair Allan wrote about
e-government information and its challenges; Robin Rice addressed issues
of access and the uses of open access publishing and digital
repositories; and Melanie Wright described the many changes in
delivering data using the Internet and this impact on data services.

Their articles are available at the [SOSIG
website](http://www.sosig.ac.uk/socsciweek/) and are listed individually
