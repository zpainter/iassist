The National Center for Education Statistics'
(NCES) [Datalab](http://nces.ed.gov/datalab/), introduced earlier this
year by the United States Department of Education, provides a
user-friendly entry to NCES data.  The home page, linked above, links to

-   [QuickStats](http://nces.ed.gov/datalab/quickstats/default.aspx) for
    users of summary data needing quick tables or charts (requires
    click-through agreement to terms of use)
-   PowerStats for users of microdata needing to run linear and logistic
    regressions (requires free user registration)
-   [Library](http://nces.ed.gov/quicktables/) for users looking for
    prepared summary tables
-   Links to the [Restricted-Use Data Procedures
    Manual](http://nces.ed.gov/statprog/rudman/)

NCES also promises to soon make available tables already created via the
QuickStats and PowerStats tools which would be potentially the most
powerful aspect of the Datalab.
