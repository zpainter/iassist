## What Awaits at IASSIST & CARTO 2024

**The countdown to IASSIST & CARTO 2024 is on, and with just more than a week left in the early bird registration period, now is an ideal time to secure your spot. Join us in the charming city of Halifax, Nova Scotia, on Canada's picturesque East coast, for a week of insightful discussions and networking opportunities.**

This year's program boasts a diverse range of sessions, offering valuable insights for data professionals everywhere. With 50 years of history, IASSIST brings together a community of data experts, in social sciences and beyond, offering a platform for knowledge-sharing and collaboration. Arranging an annual conference is one of the association’s traditions that has already been passed down from one generation of data professionals to another.

Wondering what makes this event a must-attend? We've reached out to key figures within IASSIST, including program committee chairpersons and local organising committee co-chairs, to highlight why participating in the conference is a worthwhile endeavour.

### What can IASSIST as a community offer to a researcher, data repository manager, or data librarian, i.e. a data professional or an aspiring data professional?

"Everyone brings their own skills and experience to a job in data services. IASSIST offers a network that helps you realise your strengths in the data field as well as areas for improvement, building your confidence, especially if you work alone in your role at your institution," says **Robin Rice**, the President of IASSIST and a long-time IASSIST member.

"IASSIST is known for being super friendly, and because it’s been around for 50 years, it has members across generations and a lot of fun traditions (like boat rides and dancing). There are a lot of ways to get involved in the organisation, from joining (or starting) an interest group, doing peer review for the journal or conference, and being elected to help run the association. We have always been international, and now we are getting more members from the Global South, making us more broadly relevant and able to make a difference in research data practices everywhere."  

"IASSIST offers an international community of your counterparts. IASSIST has librarians, data managers, data producers, archivists, and institutional repository managers who are happy to provide advice, answer questions, and collaborate. Join a community in which its members know what you do and share your passion," concludes **Bobray Bordelon**, Vice-President for IASSIST. 

### What can I expect to learn if I attend the conference and workshops?

"All kinds of things!" the co-chairs of the program committee affirm – undoubtedly with enthusiasm.

There is an incredibly varied programme this year, ranging from reproducibility to remote sensing and data collection. After a day of hands-on learning at our workshops, attendees will have many opportunities to hear about emerging trends and theoretical work and learn from colleagues’ and scholars' practical experiences and professional practice.

"The theme of the conference this year is about looking to the future and navigating the complexity and opportunities therein. Many presentations this year touch on timely topics such as working with data and AI, the importance of integrating social justice concepts into our work, environment sustainability, and what the future of data services will look like," note the program committee co-chairs **Sophia Lafferty-Hess**, **Kristi Thompson** and **Zach MacDonald**.

"We also have presentations on core applications from our field from data discovery, access and metadata to data management and archiving to data literacy to how we work with each other through partnerships and collaborations," they conclude.

### Why should I take the opportunity to travel onsite to attend IASSIST & CARTO 2024? 

"Halifax is at the heart of the Canadian Atlantic region, offering a relaxing and rejuvenating atmosphere and a conference venue steps from the majestic harbour and sea life. Admire the natural beauty and history as a backdrop to this international gathering of data professionals," answer the local arrangements committee co-chairs **Amber Leahey** and **Sandra Sawchuk**.

"It’s a unique 4-day programme, featuring plenary speakers, workshops, peer-reviewed sessions and papers, posters, Birds of a Feather sessions, lightning talks, and much more! Join Canadian and international data professionals from services from across academic, government, and private industry in navigating the future of data!"

### What can we expect from the social program and what are the highlights of Halifax in May? 

"Marking the 49th Annual IASSIST and 57th CARTO conferences, coming to Halifax and Nova Scotia in May will be a spectacular time of year to visit and enjoy the sea breeze", our conference hosts say. 

Seafaring, busy ports, coastal life and seafood are hallmarks of the city. But don't forget the gardens, the fortress or the historical quarters. Halifax is a walkable city, and you can see many attractions, museums or restaurants on foot from the conference venue. Halifax Central Library is known for its innovative design and only a short walk away from the conference venue.

"Be sure to get involved in IASSIST & CARTO traditions and social program events," advise Amber and Sandra.

A welcome reception will be held at the conference venue on the evening of Tuesday May 28th to help you get you acquainted and ready for the week ahead!

A poster session with refreshments will be held on Wednesday May 29th in the afternoon and will be packed with interesting projects and innovative updates from across our community!

Come celebrate IASSIST and CARTO conferences together at the Cable Wharf restaurant on the evening of Thursday May 30th. Full reception dinner and waterfront sights to behold!
