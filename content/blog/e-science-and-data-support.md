This was tweeted to our site last week, but in case you weren't
following the tweets, this is  worth a read.  There are quotes from
IASSIST folks, and there is some interesting information in it, in terms
of what people are doing.  This  may help shape what you are doing.   It
has been blogged and tweeted elsewhere and is now posted on the Educause
site.

I think there is some interesting information in the section on
"staffing e-science Activities" that might help define a what a
'designation' for someone in this field may look like.  It may also
help outline what sort of training we could do when moving individuals
into e-sciences.   This is something that I know we have tallked about
at IASSIST.

The report highlights in a positive light that 72% of respondents have a
Library Science degree at the masters level or higher.  Not being a
librarian myself, I like to focus on the fact that 28% do not have
this.   I think at the end of the day bringing these two types of
professionals together leads to better outcomes, rather than trying to
roll all of it into one person.  Or maybe I want to suggest we have not
evolved the role(s) enough to have many people who bring all things to
the table.  :-)
