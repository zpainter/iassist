The RIN (Research Information Network) has recently published a draft
consultation paper - *Stewardship of digital research data: a framework
of principles and guidelines* (April 2007) and are seeking feedback from
practitioners.

The draft discusses the shared framework of principles and guidelines
required for key stakeholders (researchers, research institutions,
funding bodies, libraries, data managers, learned societies and
publishers) in order to maximise the potential benefits of digital
research data and to help ensure that 'ideas and knowledge derived from
publicly-funded research should be made available and accessible for
public use, interrogation, and scrutiny, as widely, rapidly and
effectively as practicable.'

In addition to a collaborative approach the paper highlights the need to
make explicit the roles and responsibilities of the key players in the
research and research communications processes whilst remaining
sensitive to: the needs of the researcher; the context in which the
research is conducted; the requirements of different kinds of research
data (words, numbers, pictures, sound); how the data were generated
(purpose and process) and by whom.

RIN believes there are 5 principles reflecting the research data
lifecycle which should be adopted by universities, colleges, research
institutions and funding bodies, namely:

**Roles and responsibilities** -- collaborative codes of practice

**Standards and quality assurance** -- creation and collection in
accordance with international standards

**Access, usage and credit** -- easy to find and easy to use

**Benefits and cost effectiveness** -- efficient data management and
access

**Preservation and sustainability --** accessibility for current and
future generations
