#### ***Connectors, Crusaders, and Collaborators***

[Jill's
post](http://iassistdata.org/blog/how-do-i-do-qualitative-research-bridging-gap-between-qualitative-researchers-and-methods-res-0)
from last week detailed ways we data-support professionals can connect
researchers to library collections and other information sources for
bridging the [qualitative methods
gap](http://iassistdata.org/blog/how-do-i-do-qualitative-research-bridging-gap-between-qualitative-researchers-and-methods-resou).
I'd like to offer more ideas for how we can act not only as
***connectors*** but also as ***crusaders*** and ***collaborators*** on
our campuses specifically in the realm of providing and developing
qualitative-research teaching resources. 

Because we work with researchers across campus and in various
capacities, data-support professionals are often more aware of methods
gaps than are the academic departments we support. As such, we are
well-positioned to act as intermediaries to address these gaps by
***connecting*** researchers to existing resources and ***crusading***
for additional resources. For example:

-   We can use our cross-disciplinary knowledge to connect researchers
    to resources (including other people) about which they may be
    unaware:
    -   "Did you know that the College of Education offers a qualitative
        methods class that's open to any discipline?"
    -   "Do you know about [ResearchTalk's Qualitative Research Summer
        Intensive](http://researchtalk.com/upcoming-events/)?"
    -   "Professor X does narrative analysis - maybe you should contact
        them to see if they'd be on your dissertation committee?"
    -   "Professor Y does mixed-methods research - perhaps they'd be
        willing to consult on the qualitative aspects of your research,
        and maybe even be a co-investigator?"
-   When we encounter campus researchers experiencing this qualitative
    methods gap, we can document these occasions and then share them
    with those who can affect positive change:
    -   Tell chairs of academic departments and/or methods professors
        that graduate students attending qualitative analysis software
        workshops want this training integrated into their qualitative
        methods class.
    -   Contact the Graduate School and recommend they coordinate
        student support groups focused on qualitative research [Liz's
        post next week will have even more community-building
        suggestions].
    -   Share information gleaned from research consultations and/or
        instruction sessions with your library administrators to
        advocate for funds for qualitative-research
        collections/e-resources and for your own professional
        development in qualitative methods training.

In addition to connecting and crusading, we data-support professionals
can ***collaborate*** with other campus researchers to buttress
qualitative methods training on campuses. For example:

-   We can reach out to faculty who are teaching methods courses to
    highlight useful resources for developing their curriculum:
    -   Make them aware of sample data sets or case studies they might
        employ for teaching activities and exercises (e.g., [UK Data
        Service's
        Qualibank](https://discover.ukdataservice.ac.uk/qualibank), the
        [Qualitative Data Repository](https://qdr.syr.edu/),
        [ICPSR](https://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/), and [Sage
        Research Methods Online (SRM)](http://methods.sagepub.com/) if
        your institution subscribes to it).
    -   Point them toward qualitative methods curricular resources
        (e.g., the [Syllabi
        Collection](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/moynihan/cqrm/Syllabi_Database/)
        compiled by the [Center for Qualitative and Multi-Method
        Inquiry](https://www.maxwell.syr.edu/moynihan/cqrm/CQMI_at_Syracuse/)).
    -   Highlight your library's collections, spaces, software, and
        services that support qualitative methods (e.g., market
        qualitative analysis software training options that they might
        embed in their course).

-   Librarians can draw on their own expertise and also partner with
    qualitative researchers on campus to offer presentations, workshops,
    brown bags, etc., aimed at addressing the qualitative methods gap:
    -   In my [presentation with sociology professor Dr. Ralph LaRossa,
        "The Logics and Logistics of Qualitative
        Research"](https://works.bepress.com/amanda_swygart-hobaugh/36/),
        Dr. LaRossa discusses the methodological steps involved in
        building theoretically-rich qualitative analyses, then I outline
        the specific features of NVivo qualitative research software
        that complement and facilitate these analyses.
    -   When teaching qualitative research softwares such as
        [NVivo](http://www.qsrinternational.com/what-is-nvivo),[Atlas.ti](http://atlasti.com/),
        [Quirkos](https://www.quirkos.com/index.html),
        [MAXQDA](http://www.maxqda.com/), or
        [Dedoose](http://www.dedoose.com/), pointedly integrate
        methodological concepts along with teaching the mechanics (e.g.,
        "Grounded Theory in the Atlas.ti Environment," "Using NVivo
        Memos to Document your Methodological Process," "Developing
        Variables and Rich Coding Schemas using NVivo Hierarchical
        Nodes," "De-Identifying Interview Transcripts in Quirkos," etc.)

These are just a few ideas for how we can use the three Cs (connecting,
crusading, and collaborating) to address this qualitative methods gap.
What ideas do you have? What are your successes in this area? Or your
slip-ups that we can all learn from?

Stayed tuned for Part 4 of our blog series next week, when [Liz
Cooper](https://ulls.unm.edu/people/directory/Liz-Elizabeth-Cooper) will
address how librarians and other data-support professionals can help
build community at their institutions around qualitative research.
