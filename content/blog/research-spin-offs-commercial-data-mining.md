Edmonton Journal technology columnist Steve Makris wrote about recent
developments in data mining that could have potential implications for
providing access to confidential social survey data (see "Hot Data,"
Edmonton Journal, Business, G1, May 17, 2006.) Makris mentioned some
major companies raiding each other's data mining experts, such as
Google hiring Kai-Fu Lee away from Microsoft only to see Microsoft swoop
up Rakesh Agrawal from IBM. Can these companies capitalize on the
massive data accumulated by private companies and governments through
data mining technology?

While short on actual detail, the news of commercial investment in
technology to share private information is worth monitoring for the
social data research community.
