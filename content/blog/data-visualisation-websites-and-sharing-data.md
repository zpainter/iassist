Jim sent me a message earlier today about a new data visualisation
website that he had discovered:
[StatCrunch](http://www.statcrunch.com/%20). When I took a look at this
site, I encountered an appeal for people to upload and share their data,
which struck a familiar chord. It seems that all of these web-based
visualisation tools make a similar appeal. This certainly is true of
[Swivel](http://www.swivel.com/),
[Data360](http://www.data360.org/index.aspx) and [Many
Eyes](https://services.alphaworks.ibm.com:443/manyeyes/app).

Thinking back to an earlier era, statistical package vendors always
included some data with their software. I remember Minitab shipping a
variety of data files with its program. To some extent, data have been
used to market products. However, now it seems that all these new
visualization tools are getting into data repository services as part of
their promotion strategy. I'm not a fan of this approach. Instead of
each new tool site building its own data repository, I wish the vendors
would promote the establishment and use of open data repositories.
Encourage people to share their data with services that are foremost
*data* services and not software services.
