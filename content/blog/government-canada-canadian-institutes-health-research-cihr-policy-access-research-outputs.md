The[CIHR Policy on Access to Research
Outputs](http://www.cihr-irsc.gc.ca/e/32005.html) demonstrates the
CIHR's belief that greater access to research publications and data
will promote the ability of researchers in Canada and abroad to use and
build on the knowledge needed to address significant health challenges.
