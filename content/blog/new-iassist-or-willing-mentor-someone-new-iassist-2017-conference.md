New to IASSIST or Willing to Mentor Someone New?

We are excited to have new members in IASSIST. IASSIST is a home for
data services professionals across many disciplines: librarians, data
archivists, open data proponents, data support staff, etc. For some, it
is an organization where you don't have to explain what you do because
our members already understand. We get metadata, data support, data
access issues, database challenges, the challenge of replication and so
much more! Although we are a long-established organization, new members
are the lifeblood of IASSIST!
Networking is a great benefit of attending the IASSIST conference but
the week quickly goes by and and it can be daunting to join a lively
group like this. To get the most out of your membership, we encourage
everyone to join the IASSIST mentorship program.Please sign up by
Friday, May 12 using [Google
