-   The major activity of the Data Management & Curation Interest Group
    (SIGDMC) in the last year was the conceptualization, organization,
    submission, and offering of the June 2, 2014, morning workshop Data
    Management & Curation: Lessons from Government, Academia, and
    Research. It features seven invited presenters, and session and
    breakout group moderators from the SIGDMC membership, which also
    provided input on the breakout group topics.
-   As of May 26, 2014 SIGDMC membership is at just under 70, having
    been fairly steady over the year in terms of Google Group
    membership.  
-   The Data Management and Curation Resources page on the IASSIST
    website has been reviewed and updated. The list now contains 59
    resources;  9 new resources were added since May 2013. Minglu Wang,
    Limor Peer and Wendy Mann are responsible for this resource. 
-   Progress was made in keeping the IASSIST blog active, however, we
    did not quite meet our goal of one blog per month. 
-   The members who attend the annual IASSIST conference in Toronto have
    been invited to participate in an in-person meeting on June 4, where
    the election outcome of the successor of Carol Perry as co-chair
    will first be announced, and future goals for the group be
    discussed.**
