The [ARL NSF Resources for Data Management
Planning](http://www.arl.org/focus-areas/e-research/data-access-management-and-sharing/nsf-data-sharing-policy%20 "ARL NSF Resources for Data Management Planning")
pulls together resources for research libraries to support their
researchers in complying with the NSF Data Sharing Policy. This portal
represents a variety of sites containing examples, data management
tools, and data repositories. Professionals can participate in ARL's
Group on Data Sharing Support.
