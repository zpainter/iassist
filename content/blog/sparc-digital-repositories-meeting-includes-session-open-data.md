Kathleen Shearer of the Canadian Association of Research Libraries
organized and chaired a panel on Open Data was held at the SPARC Digital
Repositories meeting on November 8, 2010.  IASSIST members Gail
Steinhart and Chuck Humphrey were two of the three members on this
panel.  Kevin Ashley, Director of the Digital Curation Centre (DCC), was
the third.  It has been two years since this group last met and the
attendance was said to have doubled between meetings (looked like there
were around 150 people present.)  Those attending seemed to be
responsible for managing or supporting the digital repository on their
campus or active in open access publishing.  

Gail spoke about the staging repository for research data at Cornell and
the formation of a Research Data Management Service Group (RDMSG) on her
campus (see <http://data.research.cornell.edu/>).  The RDMSG is a joint
initiative of the Senior Vice Provost for Research and the University
Librarian.

Kevin discussed the activities of the DCC and addressed the need to
train more research data specialists.  He concluded his presentation
with a teaser about an important upcoming meeting in the UK on cloud
computing and research data.  

Chuck spoke about relationships among the variety of players in the data
landscape and used the example of managing the data from the Canadian
International Polar Year to describe three different models by which
digital repositories could collaborate among themselves and other
players in the data landscape.

Both Gail and Chuck mentioned the importance of Ann Green and Myron
Gutmann's seminal work on relationships among domain archives and
digital repositories (see Ann Green and Myron Gutmann, "Building
partnerships among social science researchers, institution-based
repositories and domain specific data arrchives," **OCLC Systems &
Services**, Vol. 23 (1), pp. 35-53).

Chuck asked the audience during his presentation how many of those
attending had data libraries at their institution.  The show of hands
was surprisingly few.  It may be that those working with digital
repositories are not aware of data library services at their
institution.  This may be a new community for IASSIST to establish
relationships and build greater awareness.
