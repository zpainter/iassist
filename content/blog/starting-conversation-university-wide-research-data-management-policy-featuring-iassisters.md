[Starting the Conversation: University-wide Research Data Management
Policy](http://www.oclc.org/content/dam/research/publications/library/2013/2013-08.pdf)
An OCLC Research Report by: Ricky Erway, OCLC Research

**Key highlights:**

-   The benefits of funder-required data management planning should
    apply to all research data 
-   Research and Compliance Offices, IT, Academic units, the Library,
    and Researchers should be involved in setting policy
-   An entrepreneurial person may need to get things going---why not the
    library director?

*Starting the Conversation: University-wide Research Data Management
Policy* is a call for action that summarizes the benefits of systemic
data management planning and identifies the stakeholders and their
concerns. It also suggests that the library proactively initiate a
conversation among these stakeholders to get buy-in for a high-level,
responsible data planning and management policy that is proactive,
rather than reactive, and is also supported and sustainable.

**The Stakeholders identified in the report include:**

-   The University
-   The Office of Research
-   The Research Compliance Office
-   The Information Technology Department
-   The Researchers
-   The Academic Units
-   The Library

The intended audience for this call for action is library directors, not
because they alone can make this happen, but to encourage them to
initiate the conversation. The bulk of the document advocates for the
library director to initiate a conversation among the stakeholders and
addresses the various topics that should be discussed. A checklist of
issues is also provided to help the discussion result in a supportable
and sustainable policy.

**Suggested elements of the conversation include:**

-   Who owns the data?
-   What Requirements are Imposed By Others?
-   Which Data Should Be Retained?
-   For How Long Should Data Be Maintained?
-   How Should Digital Data Be Preserved?
-   Are there Ethical Considerations?
-   How are Data Accessed?
-   How Open Should the Data Be?
-   How Will Costs Be Managed?
-   What are the Alternatives to Local Data Management?

Library directors are invested not only because their libraries may be
recipients of data in need of curation and of requests for guidance, but
more importantly because library staff have significant skills and
experience to contribute to the discussion. This is an opportunity for
the library director to play an entrepreneurial role in furthering the
mission of the larger enterprise.
