Google has announced a new service, that might make it possible for the
data community to collaborate to build a customized data-finder. The
service is the [Google Custom Search Engine
(CSE)](http://www.google.com/coop/cse/).

Similar in some ways to [Rollyo](http://www.rollyo.com/), a service that
has been around for some time, the Google CSE has several nice features:

-   Limit results of a Google search to specific sites.
-   Exclude sites from search results.
-   Collaborate on the selection of the sites to search and exclude
-   Customize the search results page
-   Add "refinements" that make it easy for users to refine search
    results
-   Eliminate Google ads if hosted by a university, government agency,
    or non-profit

There is a story about the service on eWeek: [Google Copies Rollyo's
Business Plan, Inserts
AdSense](http://oraclewatch.eweek.com/blogs/google_watch/archive/2006/10/24/14133.aspx)
(October 24, 2006 4:01 AM) by Steve Bryant. There will surely be lots
more in the news soon.

Has anyone else started experimenting with this? I'd be interested in
working with a small group to start experimenting. If you are already
doing something or would like to start, let me know. (jajacobs at
