> In this regard, we are excited to announce that we have acquired
> Gapminder's Trendalyzer software, and we welcome the Trendalyzer team
> to Google. Trendalyzer generates moving graphics and other novel
> effects in the display of facts, figures, and statistics in
> presentations. In its nimble hands, Trendalyzer views development
> data---such as regional income distribution or trends in global
> health---as literally a world of opportunity. Like Google, Gapminder
> strives to make information more useful, and Trendalyzer will improve
> any function or application in which data might be better visualized.

> Gathering data and creating useful statistics is an arduous job that
> often goes unrecognized. We hope to provide the resources necessary to
> bring such work to its deserved wider audience by improving and
> expanding Trendalyzer and making it freely available to any and all
> users capable of thinking outside the X and Y axes.
