**Spring 2017**

Mongolia is large and sparsely populated country, with nomadic
traditions, but rapidly modernizing.  As in any modern country, there is
an important role for data to play in planning and development, and
Mongolian data professionals are developing themselves to meet the
challenge.

Last year in May 2017, **Ryan Womack** (currently serving as IASSIST
Secretary) was invited to give a two-day workshop on **[Topics in Data
Science](https://rucore.libraries.rutgers.edu/rutgers-lib/52378/) **at
the **[National Statistics Office of
Mongolia](http://www.en.nso.mn/)**.  There were 33 attendees from the
NSO and a cross-section of Mongolian government agencies focusing on
data.  

IASSIST generously provided sponsorship to cover the cost of
participants' lunches during the event, which were held at the
delightful "Modern Nomads" restaurant, serving traditional Mongolian
cuisine.  While the workshop participants were refreshed by the meals,
this event also gave the opportunity to familiarize a group of Mongolian
data professionals with the work of IASSIST.

A key organizer of the event on the Mongolian side was **Ch.
Davaasuren**, Research and Development Director of the **[Mongolian
Marketing Consulting Group](http://www.mmcg.mn/) **[pictured at the
left in the video above].  His assistance was invaluable in arranging
all of the contacts, schedules, meals, translations, and other details
of the visit.  His expertise and concern for data issues was also
evident throughout.  MMCG is the leading survey research organization in
Mongolia and conducts surveys for international business, NGOs, and
nonprofit organizations on marketing, social, and political topics.

The visit to Mongolia also included talks by Ryan Womack at the National
University of Mongolia, the Mongolian University of Life Sciences, and
the Mongolian University of Science and Technology.  This provided an
opportunity to meet with academics working with data and statistics in
Mongolia, and another chance to introduce the Mongolian data community
to IASSIST.  Further details and photos from that visit are

**Spring 2018**

Flash forward to this year.  Ch. Davaasuren maintained his interest in
IASSIST that had begun from the prior year's meeting.  

Ch. Davaasuren applied for and was selected as an **IASSIST Fellow**,
and will attend IASSIST/CARTO 2018 in Montréal.  Davaasuren's most
recent conference experience was as the lead organizer for the first
**A[sia Pacific Research
Committee](http://aprc-research.com/)**conference ever to be held in
Mongolia.  APRC is focused on developing market research methodology in
the Asia-Pacific region, and may be a useful partner in extending
IASSIST's outreach in Asia. Davaasuren is also Chair of the Mongolian
Marketing Research Association.

Ryan Womack has also continued his interest in Mongolia, and was invited
to teach a one-week **[Short Course on Multivariate Statistical Methods
with R](https://github.com/ryandata/multivariate)**at the **[Mongolian
University of Life Sciences](http://en.muls.edu.mn)** in February.  That
visit is profiled, with
photos, [here](https://ryandata.wordpress.com/2018/03/08/mongolian-multivariate-statistics-at-the-mongolian-university-of-life-sciences/). 
Continued discussions with the Mongolian University of Life Sciences and
the National Statistics Office of Mongolia promise further
collaborations in the future.

With Davaasuren coming to Montréal, it will be a chance to meet with
other IASSISTers and hopefully to broaden the base of Mongolian
connections to IASSIST, and vice versa, further internationalizing our
organization.  IASSIST event sponsorships and the IASSIST Fellows
Program can catalyze that process.
