The Council of European Social Science Data Archives (CESSDA) redesigned
web site is now online at
[[http://](http://www.cessda.org/)]{.166431011-20032007}[www.cessda.org](http://www.cessda.org/).
In addition to the new layout, the site has several new features
including the CESSDA Data Portal which allows easy access to the
catalogues of member organisations. Other pages provide a central news
forum about CESSDA activities, links to official documents, contact
details and other relevant information. The site's content will
continue to be developed and will include a members' section.

CESSDA also has a new email address: cessda@cessda.org.

The CESSDA Data Portal provides a seamless interface to datasets from
social science data archives across Europe. The data may be located in
several ways, for example by searching or browsing by topic, keyword or
data publisher. The data portal may be searched and viewed in any one of
nine languages.

Most of the datasets are freely available for academic use. However the
individual data archives have different access conditions for their
materials. Consult the relevant data archive for more information about
these access conditions and possible charges.

The CESSDA Data Portal builds on the work of the EU-funded project
Multilingual Access to Data Infrastructures of the European Research
Area (MADIERA). The project was based on the DDI (Data Documentation
Initiative) specifications for documenting datasets, the European
Language Social Science Thesaurus (ELSST) enabling multilingual
functionality, and the Nesstar technology providing functionality for
browsing and analysing data.
