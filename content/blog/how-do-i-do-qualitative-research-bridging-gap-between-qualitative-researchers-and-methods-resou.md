The **[IASSIST Qualitative Social Science & Humanities Data Interest
Group (QSSHDIG)](https://sites.google.com/uncg.edu/iassistqsshdig/)**
was created in October 2016, its central purpose: to foster
conversations regarding the needs of researchers who generate
qualitative data, and what types of services librarians and other
information professionals can develop to support these researchers in
managing their data/source materials throughout the research lifecycle.

**This four-post blog series engages in one particular conversation:**
challenges researchers face in terms of a lack of qualitative methods
training, and strategies for how data-support professionals can address
these challenges. The following QSSHDIG members are the series authors:

-   [Jill Conte](http://library.nyu.edu/people/jill-conte/), Social
    Sciences Librarian at New York University
-   [Liz
    Cooper](https://ulls.unm.edu/people/directory/Liz-Elizabeth-Cooper),
    Social Sciences Librarian at the University of New Mexico
-   [Mandy
    Swygart-Hobaugh](http://library.gsu.edu/profile/mandy-swygart-hobaugh/),
    Social Sciences Librarian at Georgia State University

To foster conversation, we welcome comments here, emails to the IASSIST
listserv, the [QSSHDIG google
group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/iassist-qualdata), or
directly to the authors, and/or comments in this ["Blog Conversations"
doc](https://sites.google.com/uncg.edu/iassistqsshdig/blog-conversations) embedded
in the QSSHDIG website. Also, there's a section at the bottom of the
"Blog Conversations" doc for suggesting future QSSDHIG posts - please
do!

***Why have this conversation?***

Many social science researchers (students and faculty alike) are
increasingly conducting qualitative research while lacking formal
training in qualitative methods. This may be due to various factors,
including but not limited to the following:

-   their particular discipline does not widely embrace qualitative
    research,
-   their discipline just recently began emphasizing mixed methods
    (using qualitative and quantitative methods) when previously it was
    predominantly quantitative-based,
-   they are in an interdisciplinary academic program without a strong
    research methods training component.

Those of us who offer training sessions on qualitative data analysis
software (such as
[NVivo](http://www.qsrinternational.com/what-is-nvivo),[Atlas.ti](http://atlasti.com/),
[Quirkos](https://www.quirkos.com/index.html), or
[Dedoose](http://www.dedoose.com/)) often experience researchers coming
to these sessions without the methodological background to *do*
qualitative research or understand what the software can/cannot do for
them - sometimes hoping that the software will have the "magic button"
to solve their lack of training. Similarly, as social science liaison
librarians we often witness this qualitative methods gap during our
research consultations. Although this dilemma of lack of methods
training is not unique to qualitative research (i.e., researchers
lacking quantitative research training are known to attend statistical
software training sessions), when compared to their quantitative
counterparts, qualitative researchers often have less resources for
support and for building necessary skills.

The three posts in the remainder of this blog series will offer concrete
strategies for how data-support professionals can act as bridges between
social science researchers and the resources they need to strengthen
their qualitative research and methodologies skills:

-   **[Jill Conte's
    post](http://iassistdata.org/blog/how-do-i-do-qualitative-research-bridging-gap-between-qualitative-researchers-and-methods-res-0)**
    will offer suggestions for connecting researchers with secondary and
    tertiary sources for qualitative research training. [to be posted

-   **[Mandy Swygart-Hobaugh's
    post](http://iassistdata.org/blog/how-do-i-do-qualitative-research-bridging-gap-between-qualitative-researchers-and-methods-res-1)**
    will share ideas for developing and providing training resources in
    collaboration with faculty and academic departments that are mindful
    of this methods gap. [to be posted Monday, July 31] 
-   **[Liz Cooper's
    post](http://iassistdata.org/blog/how-do-i-do-qualitative-research-bridging-gap-between-qualitative-researchers-and-methods-res-2)**
    will address how librarians and other data-support professionals can
    help build community at their institutions around qualitative
    research. [to be posted Monday, August 7]
