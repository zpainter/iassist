I am just attending CANHEIT and saw a presentation on 
http://islandora.ca .  I thought this was a really neat project and I
really like their appliance approach to distributing this.    In a way I
thought  what they are building  touched on some of the vision presented
by Pascal at http://ciser.cornell.edu/IASSIST/program/d3.shtm .
