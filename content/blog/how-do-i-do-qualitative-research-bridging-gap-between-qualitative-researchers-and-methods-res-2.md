[Last week
Mandy](http://www.iassistdata.org/blog/how-do-i-do-qualitative-research-bridging-gap-between-qualitative-researchers-and-methods-res-1) shared
ideas about how librarians and other data-support professionals can act
as connectors, crusaders and collaborators on campus in order to better
provide and develop qualitative research teaching resources. This week
we want to build on Mandy's suggestions by looking a bit more broadly at
how librarians and other data-support professionals can help build
community around qualitative research at their institutions.

As qualitative research methods are often not the dominant methodologies
used in departments and institutions, qualitative researchers may not
have a strong support network and may lack colleagues to consult with or
learn from. I have regularly heard from graduate students embarking on a
qualitative project that they are struggling to learn about qualitative
methods on their own because their advisor doesn't know much about
qualitative research or because their department does not offer a course
in qualitative research methods. I have also heard from the lone
qualitative research faculty member in a department about how isolating
that can be. So building a community where qualitative researchers can
support, connect with and learn from each other can be very important.
Libraries, often seen as neutral ground on campus, have an opportunity
to play a unique role as facilitators building this community by
connecting people and leveraging resources from across campus.

Some activities that librarians and data support professionals may want
to consider to help build a qualitative research community on their
campus include:

-   Conduct an environmental scan.  Each campus has a different research
    support environment, so it may help to first do an environmental
    scan of your campus to learn who is already doing what to support
    qualitative research. Document what you learn! Think about how the
    library can bring together existing resources and build on them.
-   Then, act as a clearinghouse around qualitative methods and support.
    As you investigate what is going on across your campus related to
    qualitative research, compile and publicize what you find.  For
    example, you may create:

1.  lists of campus resources, including labs and software/support tools
    available,
2.  lists of qualitative methods courses offered in departments across
    campus,
3.  a directory of faculty members with strengths in qualitative
    research who agree to act as a resource for others.

As Jill mentioned in our second blogpost, Libguides/research guides are
often a great way to capture and share this type of information with the
university community and with  library colleagues. Additionally, sharing
this information through other campus organizations, such as a graduate
resource center, might be a good way to reach an audience with related
needs. 

-   Establish/host/contribute to a campus listserv for those with
    questions or who need help working with qualitative methods and
    tools.
-   Partner with faculty/graduate students/other campus departments to
    establish/host a qualitative research support group on your campus.
    These could be informal brown bags, reading groups, or a place for
    attendees to meet others and ask questions of those  interested in
    similar issues.
-   Consider helping to establish a mentor program partnering those new
    to qualitative research with more experienced researchers.
-   Host/organize/co-sponsor a qualitative research event/symposium -
    this not only fosters building a vibrant qualitative research
    community but can help demonstrate the library's commitment to
    serving this community.
-   Offer library spaces and resources to support qualitative groups,
    events, etc.

I hope these suggestions get you started thinking about ways to build a
community on your campus. We'd love to hear what you are already doing
and we welcome comments here, emails to the IASSIST listserv, the
[QSSHDIG google
group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/iassist-qualdata), or
directly to the authors, and/or comments in this ["Blog Conversations"

This is the last of our 4-part blog series, ["How Do I *Do*

QSSHDIG would love to get more conversations going on the IASSIST blog -
