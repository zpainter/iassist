| asked to perform quality of life benchmarking, track local trends, or |
| develop information in support of business recruitment, industry      |
| cluster building, economic impact assessments, incentive awards, and  |
| planning efforts.  Ways to effectively communicate the results from   |
| this research to plicy leaders and practitioners are covered. Learn   |
