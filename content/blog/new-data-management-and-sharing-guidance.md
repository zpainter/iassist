The UK Data Archive would like to announce the release of its new suite
of web pages providing guidance on data management and sharing. The
pages provide data creators, data managers and data curators with best
practice strategies and methods for creating, preparing and storing
shareable datasets. Advice has been divided into a number of key areas
or modules providing detailed information on each topic. These are:

· Sharing data - why and how? · Consent, confidentiality and ethics ·
Copyright · Data documentation and metadata · Data formats and software
· Data storage, back-up, and security

In addition to these web pages, bespoke advice and training are provided
by UKDA staff throughout the lifespan of a research project - from the
initial award application, through the data creation phase to the end of
the active research phase and to the final storage and dissemination of
data. A comprehensive frequently asked questions web page is also
available.

See: <http://www.data-archive.ac.uk/sharing/>

UKDA is currently undergoing a major rebrand of its promotional
materials and web site. The data management and sharing web pages are
the first section to reflect this new look. Feedback from users of the
UKDA web site would be very welcome.

Regards Sharon Jack Senior Web Resources Officer UK Data Archive - a
service provider for the Economic and Social Data Service (ESDS)
