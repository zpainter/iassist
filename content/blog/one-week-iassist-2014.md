It's a week to go until IASSIST 2014 begins! (If you haven't registered
yet, better get to it!) Here are a few things you might like to know
before you get here:

-   If you haven't looked at them yet, please peruse the "How to get
    here" and "Local information" pages on the [conference
    website](http://www.library.yorku.ca/cms/iassist/)
-   under
    '[Visitors](http://www.library.yorku.ca/cms/iassist/visitors/)' on
    the top menu (where you can find a map-based guide to Toronto
    attractions);
    
    -   "[How to get
        here](http://www.library.yorku.ca/cms/iassist/visitors/how-to-get-here/)"
        lists ways to get to the downtown core from the airport;
    -   "[Local
        information](http://www.library.yorku.ca/cms/iassist/visitors/local/)"
        has links to maps, information on how to get around Toronto,
        links to weather information from Environment Canada, plus links
        to guides to restaurants and drinking establishments in and
        around town.
    -   If you're a baseball fan, the Toronto Blue Jays are playing home
        games on June 1, 6, and 7; see the [June
        schedule](http://mlb.mlb.com/schedule/index.jsp?c_id=tor#y=2014&m=6)
        for details.
    -   if, at any point, you want to pick up some groceries, there's a
        huge grocery store -- right next to the Mattamy Centre (site of
        the Tuesday reception) -- known as [Loblaws at Maple Leaf
        Gardens](http://www.loblaws.ca/en_CA/60carlton.html); check out
        the 'Wall of Cheese"!
    -   if your taste runs to reading, there's an
        [Indigo](http://www.chapters.indigo.ca/home/) store (Canada's
        major bookstore chain) about [10 min from the conference hotel
        by foot](http://goo.gl/aHCAM1), on Yonge St.

As far as food and drink go, the variety you'll find in the city, even
restricted to the downtown area, is nothing short of remarkable;
there's even a multicultural food court just down the street from the
conference venue. Later this week we'll be adding to the above links a
personal guide to eating and drinking establishments prepared by one of
our volunteers.

Your Local Arrangements Committee and volunteers will do our best to
ensure you have a pleasant and productive stay in Toronto. Please let us
now if you have any specific questions. We look forward to greeting you
next week for IASSIST 2014!
