  The [IASSIST Regional Conference <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=IASSIST+Regional+Conference&bbid=3981869848165693795&bpid=5050746860857341775) held in Ghana from 22nd to 24th October 2025 was a journey I had long awaited, one that had been brewing in anticipation since May 2024, when my abstract was first approved. The months leading up to the conference were filled with preparation: research refinement, logistics planning, emotional readiness, and countless mental rehearsals. I had initially planned to travel by road, driven by my love for adventure and the idea of passing through three countries (Nigeria, Benin, Togo and Ghana) before reaching my destination. The thought of such a continental exploration thrilled me deeply. Yet, at the eleventh hour, practicality outweighed sentiment, and I opted to travel by air, a decision that turned out to be absolutely remarkable.

I arrived in Ghana slightly past eight in the evening. Thanks to my seniors and professional mentors, **[Dr Toun Oyelude <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=Dr+Toun+Oyelude+University+Librarian&bbid=3981869848165693795&bpid=5050746860857341775)**, University Librarian at Olusegun Agagu University of Science and Technology, Okitipupa, Ondo State, and **Dr Sophia Adeyeye**, Head of Department of Information Science, Lead City University, Ibadan, along with her ever-pleasant friend, **Lovely Bukkie**, an elite apartment had already been secured at [Airport West <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=Airport+West+Accra+Ghana&bbid=3981869848165693795&bpid=5050746860857341775). They were such wonderful companions: cheerful, warm, and full of humour. My ride from the airport to the apartment was an early glimpse into the heart of [Accra <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=Accra+Ghana+tourism&bbid=3981869848165693795&bpid=5050746860857341775): beautifully structured roads, orderly traffic, elegant architecture, and a city illuminated with splendour. From above and on the ground, Accra exuded sophistication and order. It was impossible not to fall in love with what I saw.

{{< figure src="/img/blog/iassist-africa-2025-03-dsc_9646.jpg" class="wrap-right" link="/img/blog/iassist-africa-2025-03-dsc_9646.jpg" alt="" title="" width="300" >}}

The apartment was a five-star residence; impeccably maintained, luxurious, and comfortable. It wasn't cheap, but then again, good things seldom come cheap. The accommodation radiated elegance and provided the perfect environment to rest and prepare for the days ahead. We arrived a day before the conference, which allowed us ample time to acclimatise, plan our movements, rehearse our presentations, and sample local cuisines.

 
On the first morning, we ordered a Bolt ride and set off for the conference venue. That short journey opened up the city to us in its full majesty; modern skyscrapers, well-paved roads, and a clean, vibrant atmosphere. Ghanaians, I must say, are remarkably diligent and courteous. However, one thing that struck me was the traffic. The gridlock seemed endless, and the long waits at traffic lights, even on relatively free roads, could test anyone's patience. Yet, in all, it reflected a city growing fast and managing urban life with order and discipline.

 {{< figure src="/img/blog/iassist-africa-2025-04-dsc_9525.jpg" class="wrap-right" link="/img/blog/iassist-africa-2025-04-dsc_9525.jpg" alt="" title="" width="300" >}}

The conference venue was the Office of the Head of Local Government Services. Admittedly, my initial expectation of what a "local government office" would look like was quickly overturned. The building was breathtaking; modern, tiled, spacious, and spotless. Its location was even more strategic: surrounded by iconic structures such as the [National Theatre <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=National+Theatre+Accra+Ghana&bbid=3981869848165693795&bpid=5050746860857341775), the Ghana Economic Academy, Afua Sutherland Children's Park, Ridge Church School & Accra Ridge Church, Ministry of Business Development (Ghana), Kempinski Hotel Gold Coast City and the Children's Affairs Secretariat among others . The entire district seemed like a governmental and intellectual hub, a confluence of knowledge and civic development.

IASSIST, the International Association for Social Science Information Service and Technology, is an organisation dedicated to information scientists and data professionals globally. It serves as a nexus for innovation, collaboration, and implementation of data-driven solutions across sectors. The Africa Regional Chapter of IASSIST brought together scholars, professionals, and data experts from Ghana, Nigeria, Kenya, Uganda, and several other African nations. The theme of this year's conference ***Enhancing Data Management for Promoting Continuous Growth and a Sustainable Future for Africa*** could not have been timelier.
 
 {{< figure src="/img/blog/iassist-africa-2025-06-dsc_9679.jpg" class="wrap-right" link="/img/blog/iassist-africa-2025-06-dsc_9679.jpg" alt="" title="" width="300" >}}
 
The event commenced with an inspiring welcome address by the President of the IASSIST Africa Regional Chapter, [Professor Constant Okello-Obura <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=Professor+Constant+Okello-Obura+Uganda&bbid=3981869848165693795&bpid=5050746860857341775) from Uganda, followed by remarks from the Chapter Secretary, **Dr Winny Nekesa**, also from Uganda. The Global President of IASSIST, **[Bobray Bordelon <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=Bobray+Bordelon+Princeton+University&bbid=3981869848165693795&bpid=5050746860857341775)**, who is the Head of Data and Statistical Services and the Economics & Finance Librarian at Princeton University, United States of America, delivered a remarkable opening speech. He highlighted the focus of the association, its diverse professionals who make up the membership, its success in global data advocacy, and its peer-reviewed and indexed journal, ***IASSIST Quarterly (IQ***). He also mentioned the rebated annual membership fee of $25 for Africans and emphasised the need to translate advocacy into action across Africa. 

Yet, my most memorable moment of the opening ceremony came from the keynote speaker, [Professor Sandra Cannon <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=Professor+Sandra+Cannon+data+science&bbid=3981869848165693795&bpid=5050746860857341775), whose address centred on the indispensable role of data in the age of [Artificial Intelligence <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](). Her declaration that "there is no AI without data" struck a powerful chord. She stressed the need for Africa to treat data as a king; to collect, protect, and invest in it with the seriousness it deserves. This was a wake-up call, particularly for a continent still grappling with data governance and evidence-based decision-making.

Day One was rich and intellectually stimulating. Presentations flowed seamlessly, both physically and virtually, spanning a diverse range of topics; data literacy, artificial intelligence in information management, education data analytics, metadata automation, research data management, smart governance, open educational resources, and digital inclusion. Notable presentations came from esteemed scholars such as **Dr Adetoun Oyelude** and **Professor Adefunke Ebijuwa**, who delivered thought-provoking insights on the digital divide and open access in Africa.

A light breakfast was followed by a delightful lunch that offered a vibrant blend of flavours and textures; colourful rice, crisp salads, and [banku <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=banku+Ghana+food&bbid=3981869848165693795&bpid=5050746860857341775), a local delicacies that left a lasting impression. My presentation was originally scheduled for Day Two, but as fate would have it, I was called to present on the first day. My topic, ***Lost Knowledge, Found Future: Librarians Connecting Community Herbal Healing Traditions through Digital Preservation and Data Management***, explored how indigenous knowledge, particularly traditional herbal medicine, could be preserved and shared through modern digital technologies. I can hardly judge my own presentation, but the feedback spoke volumes. Participants described it as one of the most engaging sessions, commending both the content and visual appeal of my slides. The central takeaway was the urgent need to digitally document Africa's cultural and medicinal heritage before it fades into obscurity, ensuring accessibility for present and future generations.

 The day concluded with a lively cocktail session, complete with music and dancing; a perfect blend of networking and relaxation. The atmosphere was joyous, and conversations flowed freely among participants from diverse backgrounds. Returning to our apartment later that evening offered another chance to appreciate Accra's dazzling nightlife. The city glowed in golden hues, every street illuminated. Power supply was uninterrupted, a rare luxury in many African cities. The calmness of the night air and the serenity of our surroundings were soothing beyond words.
 
 {{< figure src="/img/blog/iassist-africa-2025-09-dsc_9919.jpg" class="wrap-right" link="/img/blog/iassist-africa-2025-09-dsc_9919.jpg" alt="" title="" width="300" >}}
 
Day Two arrived quickly, filled with renewed energy and scholarly excitement. Presentations continued across multiple panels, each one as stimulating as the last. Topics ranged from sustainable data ecosystems to open science frameworks and AI governance. By the afternoon, participants gathered for a communal lunch followed by a special dinner event that celebrated collaboration and unity. At the close of the second day, my colleagues and I; true to our Nigerian spirit of curiosity, decided to explore the neighbourhood on foot instead of waiting endlessly for a ride. That short evening walk revealed a different side of Accra. Beyond the glamour and lights, we glimpsed the more modest realities of city life. Still, our admiration for the city remained intact, Accra is undeniably beautiful, well organised, and progressive.

The third and final day marked the grand finale. Experts delivered impactful recommendations on the future of data management in Africa, highlighting frameworks for sustainability, research data management (RDM), and policy-driven collaboration. There were engaging sessions led by scholars such as **Dr Sophia Adeyeye** and **Taofeek Oladokun** on building "data-ready librarians" and promoting communities of practice, as well as by **Dr Osagie Oseghale** on Community of Practice (CoP) in Africa. The highlight of the closing ceremony was the announcement of the Best Paper Award, which proudly went to our very own scholars; **[Professor Fehintoluwa Onifade <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=Professor+Fehintoluwa+Onifade+Olabisi+Onabanjo+University&bbid=3981869848165693795&bpid=5050746860857341775)** and **Dr Oyedokun Siddiqah** of Olabisi Onabanjo University, Ago-Iwoye, Ogun State, Nigeria. Their recognition was a proud moment for all the participants, reinforcing the African growing impact in data and information science research.

{{< figure src="/img/blog/iassist-africa-2025-10-dsc_9851.jpg" class="wrap-right" link="/img/blog/iassist-africa-2025-10-dsc_9851.jpg" alt="" title="" width="300" >}}

 The conference concluded on an inspiring note, leaving a deep sense of accomplishment and camaraderie among participants. Beyond the rich academic discourse, it was a true convergence of minds—a melting pot of ideas, aspirations, and shared dreams for Africa's data-driven future. I was privileged to connect with remarkable individuals such as **Dr Florence O. Entsua-Mensah**, **Edna Owusu-Bempah**, and **Rebecca**, two brilliant doctoral students; **Lawrencia Donkor Acheampong** from the University of Ghana; **Dr Augustine**, a passionate researcher on inclusive technologies for people with special needs in Ghana; **Abudil Kadir Salifu**, College Librarian at TACE, Ghana; **Dr Zotoo Isidore Komla** of the University Library, Ghana; and **Aloysius Mwanje** from the University at Buffalo, USA—truly brilliant minds. Such friendships and potential collaborations are the invisible treasures of academic gatherings. As I eagerly await the next IASSIST Regional Conference, to be hosted in Uganda, I carry with me renewed motivation and a deepened sense of purpose in advancing data literacy and open science in Africa.

As the conference drew to a close, I had to prepare for my return flight scheduled for 5:45 a.m. Our team left the apartment around 1:20 a.m., navigating the city that seemed never to sleep. Bolt and Uber drivers were readily available, street lights glowed brightly, and every corner of the city felt secure. Accra, in that quiet pre-dawn hour, radiated tranquillity and efficiency. Arriving at the airport, I met a well-organised system; courteous security officers, attentive attendants, and seamless check-in procedures. The professionalism of the Ghanaian hospitality industry left a lasting impression. Though the city is admittedly expensive, I felt I had received value for every cedi spent. The experience was enriching and refreshing in every sense.

My heartfelt gratitude goes to all who made this journey possible: the Local Organising Committee led by **Dr David Kofi Doku**, District Coordinating Director, ERCC Local Government Service, Ghana and Professor **Philip Kankam**, HoD, Information Science. University of Ghana, for their outstanding efforts; my university's management team under the leadership of Professor **Akeem Lasisi**, Vice-Chancellor, Federal University of Health Sciences, Ila-Orangun; my direct Boss, **Mrs Bukky Asubiojo**, FNLA, University Librarian; the Tertiary Education Trust Fund (TETFund) for their support; and my beloved family for their understanding and encouragement. 

As I reflect on those three unforgettable days, I am reminded that conferences are not just about presentations and papers, they are about people, places, and possibilities. Ghana, with its warmth, discipline, and charm, offered me a renewed vision of Africa's potential. Indeed, ***[Akwaaba <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://www.google.com/search?ved=1t:260882&q=Akwaaba+meaning+Ghana&bbid=3981869848165693795&bpid=5050746860857341775)*** "welcome" is more than a greeting; it is a spirit, one that makes you feel at home even miles away.
