Abstract

 

This chapter analyses the processes and dynamics of institution building
in the European Union (EU). While most studies of EU institution
building have dealt with the birth and evolution of key institutions,
such as the legislatives, the executives or the courts, the focus is
here on a different aspect of democratic governance: the informational
foundation of the EU. The chapter examines developments and changes in
the organization of numerical information in the EU, in particular the
role of Eurostat, the statistical office of the European Commission. How
and to what extent can we observe the emergence of a pan-European
informational system? How and to what extent has the European
information system in Europe interacted and worked together with
national statistical institutes?
