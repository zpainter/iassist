[DataQ](http://researchdataq.org/) is a collaborative platform for the
community to use to ask and answer questions related to research data
support in academic libraries. Library staff from any institution may
submit questions on research data topics to the DataQ website, where
questions are reviewed by an Editorial Team of experts with additional
support from an active pool of Project Volunteers. Answers to these
questions, from both the community and the Editorial Team, are posted to
the DataQ website and include links to resources and tools, best
practices, and practical approaches to working with researchers to
address specific research data issues.
