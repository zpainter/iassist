Great work by Richard Ball, an Economics professor at Haverford College
and Norm Medeiros, a Haverford librarian. I'm already planning to
incorporate their protocol into my formal and informal data literacy
instruction. I highly recommend a visit to their website: [Teaching
integrity in empirical research: a soup to nuts
protocol](http://www.haverford.edu/economics/faculty/rball/soup_to_nuts.php)

They've also [published a paper on their
work](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00220485.2012.659647).
Here's the abstract:

> This article describes a protocol the authors developed for teaching
> undergraduates to document their statistical analyses for empirical
> research projects so that their results are completely reproducible
> and verifiable. The protocol is guided by the principle that the
> documentation prepared to accompany an empirical research project
> should be sufficient to allow an independent researcher to replicate
> easily and exactly every step of the data management and analysis that
> generated the results reported in a study. The authors hope that
> requiring students to follow this protocol will not only teach them
> how to document their research appropriately, but also instill in them
> the belief that such documentation is an important professional
> responsibility.
