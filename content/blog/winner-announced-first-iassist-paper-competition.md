Dear IASSIST Members,

In our call for this year's conference we included a new Paper Track
that would require members to submit a full paper in advance of the
conference. We also created a best paper competition as an incentive to
submit. I have the pleasure to announce a winner of our first IASSIST
Paper Competition!

The winning paper was "Sustainability of Social Science Data Archives:
A Historical Network Perspective" by Kristin R. Eschenfelder, Morgaine
Gilchrist Scott, Kalpana Shankar, Ellen LeClere, Rebecca Lin, and Greg
Downey. Kristin as lead author will receive a free registration for a
future IASSIST conference, and the entire team will be recognized at the
IASSIST Business Meeting on Wednesday, June 3 at 4:45-5:15. The paper
stood out for its fit with the conference theme, relevance to IASSIST
Quarterly, and research design.

We have all submitted conference papers available on our website as a
way to encourage feedback from attendees
(https://sites.google.com/a/umn.edu/iassist-2015/paper-submissions).
Every paper will be considered for publication in IQ.

A big IASSIST thanks to our authors for helping us kick off a
potentially new tradition. Also, thank you to the sub-committee members
(Karen Hogenboom, Thomas Lindsay, Sara Holder, Michelle Edwards, and
Berenica Vejvoda) for the hard work to select a winner.

They are helping to make IASSIST 2015 the best conference ever!  See you
all soon!
