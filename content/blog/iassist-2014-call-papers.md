### ALIGNING DATA AND RESEARCH INFRASTRUCTURE IASSIST 2014 Annual Conference Call for Paper and Session Proposals

This year's conference theme touches upon the international and
interdisciplinary requirements of aligning data and research
infrastructure. The [2013 OECD Global Science Forum report on **New Data
for Understanding the Human
Condition**](http://www.oecd.org/sti/sci-tech/new-data-for-understanding-the-human-condition.htm)
identifies key challenges for international data collaboration that beg
for new solutions. Among these challenges is the mounting pressure for
new forms of social science data. In today's abundance of personal data,
new methods are being sought to combine traditional social science data
(administrative, survey, and census data) with new forms of personal
data (social networking, biomarkers or transaction data) or with data
from other domains. Similarly, the need for open data, archiving, and
long-term curation infrastructures has been identified for research data
in the natural, physical, and life sciences. Funders in all areas are
pushing to enable the replication and/or reuse of research data. *What
alignments are needed between data and research infrastructure to enable
these
possibilities?![](/img/blog/iassist2014.png "IASSIST 2014 logo"){width="256"

The international research community is in the midst of building a
global data ecosystem that consists of a mixture of domain data
repositories, data archives, data libraries, and data services and that
seeks ways to facilitate data discovery, integration, access, and
preservation. Evidence of this transformation is found in the recently
established ICSU World Data System and in the Research Data Alliance.
Like IASSIST, these organisations are contributing to the development of
a global data ecosystem. Alignment or unification of strategies must
take place at many levels to achieve this. How do we proceed? *What
advancements are needed in research data management, research
infrastructure, and the development of new expertise?*

Conference Tracks

We welcome submissions on the theme outlined above and encourage
conference participants to propose papers and sessions that will be of
interest to a diverse audience. To facilitate the organisation and
scheduling of sessions, three distinct tracks have been established. If
you are unsure which track your submission belongs or you feel that it
applies to more than one track, submit your proposal and if accepted,
the Programme Committee will find an appropriate fit.

### Track 1: Research Data Management

-   New data types and their management
-   Challenges in exchanging research data across disciplines
-   Using social science data with data from other domains
-   Data linkage in the creation of new social science data
-   Data management within the global research data ecosystem
-   Data archives and repositories in the global data ecosystem
-   Best practices in the global data ecosystem
-   Metadata enabling the interoperability of research data
-   Application of DDI, SDMX, other metadata schema, taxonomies or
    ontologies in research data management
-   Data management policies and workflow systems
-   Data attribution and citation systems

### Track 2: Professional Development

-   Training challenges given the growing number of professional
    positions within the global data ecosystem, which includes data
    curators, data scientists, data librarians, data archivists, etc.
-   Teaching end-users to work with research data
-   Data and statistical literacy
-   Data collection development in libraries and other institutions
-   Explorations of data across subject areas and geographic regions
-   Copyright clearance, privacy and confidential data
-   Working with ethics review boards and research service offices
-   Interdisciplinarity -- promoting the cross-use of data
-   Training researchers about research data management planning
-   Liaison librarians' roles in research data

### Track 3: Data Developers and Tools

-   New infrastructure requirements in the global data ecosystem
-   Infrastructure supporting Data Without Borders
-   Tools to develop and support new social science data
-   Crowdsourcing applications in producing new social science data
-   Data dives or hackathons
-   API development supporting research data management
-   Open data web services
-   Applications of research data visualisation in the social sciences
-   Preservation tools for research data
-   Tools for data mining
-   Data technology platforms: cloud computing and open stack storage

Conference Formats

The Programme Committee welcomes submissions employing any of the
following formats:

Individual proposal
:   This format consists of a 15 to 20 minute talk that is typically
    accompanied with a written paper. If your individual proposal is
    accepted, you will be grouped into an appropriate session with
    similarly themed presentations.

Session proposal
:   Session proposals consist of an identified set of presenters and
    their topics. Such proposals can suggest a variety of formats, e.g.
    a set of three to four presentations, a discussion panel, a
    discussion with the audience, etc. If accepted, the person who
    proposed the session becomes the session organiser and is
    responsible for securing speakers/participants and a chair/moderator
    (if not standing in that role him/herself).

Pecha Kucha proposal
:   A proposal for this programme event consists of a presentation of 20
    slides shown for 20 seconds each, with heavy emphasis on visual
    content. Presentations in this event are timed and speakers are
    restricted to seven minutes.

Poster or demonstrations proposal
:   Proposals in this category should identify the message being
    conveyed in a poster or the nature of the demonstration being made.

Round table discussion proposal
:   Round table discussions typically take place during lunch and have
    limited seating. Please indicate how you plan to share the output of
    your round table discussion with all of IASSIST.

Session formats are not limited to the ideas above and session
organisers are welcome to suggest other formats.

All submissions should include the proposed title and an abstract no
longer than 200 words (note: longer abstracts will be returned to be
shortened before being considered). Please note that all presenters are
required to register and pay the registration fee for the conference.
Registration for individual days will be available.

Please use this **[online submission
form](http://staff.lib.muohio.edu/%7Esekyerk/iassist14/)** to submit
your proposal. If you are unsure which track your submission fits or if
you feel it belongs in more than one track, the Program Committee will
find an appropriate place.

We also welcome workshop proposals around the same themes. Successful
proposals will blend lecture and active learning techniques. The
conference planning committee will provide the necessary classroom space
and computing supplies for workshops. For previous examples of IASSIST
workshops, please see the descriptions of [2011
workshops](http://www.rdl.sfu.ca/IASSIST/index.php/Program/category/tuesday_workshops/)
and [2013 workshops](http://www.iassist2013.org/program/workshops/).
Typically workshops are half-day with 2-hour and 3-hour options.

-   **Deadline for submission:** December 9, 2013 (2013.12.09)
-   **Notification of acceptance:** February 7, 2014 (2014.02.07).
