About a month ago I put some initial reactions to the Thomson Reuters
Data Citation Index into a [public
note](https://www.evernote.com/shard/s17/sh/d4d6fef7-7a9d-4a3a-b9b4-a7d9afc3b943/aec34c5daf270d29c985e6d3db0cb3e4).
I received some requests to do a more formal version of the same and
have finally been able to do so at <http://z.umn.edu/trdci>. It's a
Google Doc that should be public and should allow comments.

Our trial period ended in early December and it may be that some of the
problems I describe have since been resolved. It's also possible that
some of the oddities I noted would not have been present had we
subscribed. Nonetheless, even if all the problems went away and it was a
perfect version of itself, I'm still not sure that the UMN libraries
would have chosen to subscribe. The annual fee was very, very steep.
