Happy Earth Day to everyone!!

Hope your day is filled with loads of celebratory reducing, renewing,
and recycling.

Registration for this year's IASSIST Conference (May 27-30):
"Technology of Data: Collection, Communication, Access and
Preservation" is proceeding at a rumbling pace, and the five conference
hotels have been filling with eager California-bound IASSISTers.

However, if you still have not made your arrangements for this year's
conference, please consider doing so. Early registration ends soon (May
2), and of more immediate concern, the conference hotels will begin
dropping our room blocks (and guaranteed conference rates) beginning
this Friday, April 25. Exact dates for each hotel is listed on the
Accommodations page on the conference web site. Online registration and
the conference fee structure is available on the Registration page:

The Program Committee has done an excellent job at organizing a
fantastic array of workshops, plenaries, concurrent panel sessions, and
poster sessions. We have two energizing plenary speakers to kick-start
the first two days of the conference: Catherine Ruggles, who will
discuss the new technologies developed to manage complex data and
Elizabeth Miller, who will discuss the impact of technology on knowledge
and understanding. The subsequent sessions run the gamut of
technology's intersection with all we do as data professionals -- from
metadata and the DDI to tools for data visualization, from data
librarianship to data preservation and data repositories, from data
confidentiality and security to data in the classroom and statistical
literacy. Check out the full conference program schedule and
descriptions on the web site for more information.

We have also planned a few post-conference excursions that are anchored
in San Francisco at the King George Hotel in Union Square (shopping,
theater, restaurants, Chinatown). Enjoy a ball game on Friday night
(with fireworks) at AT&T Park. For the internet-addicted, bring your
laptop, they've got wireless (it is AT&T Park...). Take a train to the
Napa wine country on Saturday, and tour the city of San Francisco and
Alcatraz on Sunday. See the Post-Excursion Trips page for more details.

As we begin this last week of April, we hope that we've whetted your
appetite and got your blood going for IASSIST 2008. We are looking
forward to hosting the conference and we are especially excited at the
prospect of IASSIST invading the Silicon Valley this May!
