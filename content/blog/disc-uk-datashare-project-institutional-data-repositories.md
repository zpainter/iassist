As part of the JISC-funded [DISC-UK DataShare
project](http://www.disc-uk.org/datashare.html){.moz-txt-link-freetext}
in the UK, a State-of-the-Art Review has been written, marking out the
current scene on data sharing at the beginning of the project. While the
report is UK-focused, it may be of wider interest, and has a very
thorough bibliography.

[DISC-UK](http://www.disc-uk.org/index.html "DISC-UK") is a UK
consortium of data support professionals working in departments and
academic libraries in universities (Data Information Specialists
Committee-United Kingdom). The project is about DISC-UK members (all of
whom are also IASSIST members) working with academics and institutional
repository managers at the four partner institutions - London School of
Economics and the Universities of Edinburgh, Oxford and Southampton - to
provide exemplars for sharing research data within institutional
repositories (based on EPrints.org, DSpace and Fedora software).
