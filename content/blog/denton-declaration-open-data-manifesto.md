On May 22, 2012 at the University of North Texas (UNT), a group of
technologists, librarians, scholars, researchers, university
administrators, and other stakeholders gathered to discuss and
articulate best practices and emerging trends in research data
management. This declaration bridges the converging interests of these
stakeholders and promotes collaboration, transparency, and
accountability across organizational and disciplinary boundaries.
Declarations that emerged included the following:

-   Open access to research data is critical for advancing science,
    scholarship, and society.
-   Research data, when repurposed, has an accretive value.
-   Publicly funded research should be publicly available for public
    good.
-   Transparency in research is essential to sustain the public trust.
-   The validation of research data by the peer community is an
    essential function of the responsible conduct of research.
-   Managing research data is the responsibility of a broad community of
    stakeholders including researchers, funders, institutions,
    libraries, archivists, and the public.
