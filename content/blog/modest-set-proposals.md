The conference is on and I'm hoping to see lots of blog entries from
the interesting sessions today. I'm expecting some details on session
A1 from another contributor but.... I've been asked by Kristin Partlo
to pass along the proposals she and Rachael Barlow outlined at the end
of their presentation for further comment. So here they are! This part
of the session was on social bookmarking using sites such as del.icio.us
and furl. Kristin and Rachael would like to see a collaborative use of
such sites within the IASSIST community and have made some proposals to
that end. Comment away and let the blogging begin!

### Proposals for IASSIST

How can IASSIST use these [social bookmarking] technologies to create
a more interactive community of data providers, users, and seekers?

Here are some ways we could start:

> **Proposal 1:** Create a network of IASSIST members: Identify who
> within IASSIST is using tagging and bookmarking services. Share our
> usernames with each other
>
> **Proposal 2:** Use a shared tag to link our bookmarks sets
>
> **Proposal 3:** Decide on official tagging service for IASSIST members
>
> **Proposal 4:** Develop a tagroll for the IASSIST blog?
>
> **Proposal 5:** Teaching tagging to students and faculty

Submitted on behalf of Kristin Partlo.
