Welcome to the new (May, 2010) IASSIST website, based on Drupal open
source technology and hosted by LIS-host. The new logo and website
artwork was commissioned by the Publications Chair, Walter Piovesan, and
done by Josh Laidlaw, from British Columbia.

Harrison Dekker, from University of California-Berkeley, is our 'drupal
guru' who has done the lion's share of the work, porting over the old
content and setting up the new format.

As appointed Website Editor, I worked with Harrison and Walter
throughout the past year, meeting regularly on skype, to spec and
problem-solve, getting the website to this stage, where we are pleased
to launch it in time for the 2010 IASSIST conference at Cornell.

### Meet the new web editors:

Tuomas J. Alaterä, About (and membership) Section Editor

Carol Perry, Co-conferences Section Editor with Lu Chou

Stuart Macdonald, IQ Section Editor

Amy West, Resources Section Editor

Jennifer Darragh, Community Section Editor
