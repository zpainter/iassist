**2016-2017 Report on the IASSIST Geospatial Interest Group**

The group was founded in the Spring/Summer of 2016 and met at the 2016
Bergen conference. The central purpose of the IASSIST Geospatial
Interest Group is to create a network for members focused on issues of
geospatial data as related to the social sciences. The current chair is
Jennifer Moore (Washington University in St. Louis)

At the meeting in Bergen ([review
notes](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zYJ1KSZkSZ9D7qp0SZeTnPSFC7mNdD3dU-OklqqjEzA/edit?usp=sharing))
we discussed the merits of an IASSIST geospatial interest group in
relation to existing groups (e.g. ALA), recommending geospatial
resources and tools for institutions with limited resources available to
support GIS, and whether the interest group needs to be laser focused on
the social sciences.

 

As a result of the discussions, we developed lists of resources and
tools, which are not exhaustive.

For communication we established a [Google
Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!members/iassist_geoig), but
traffic has been light. In 2017/2018 the group may explore a more
effective communication tool.
