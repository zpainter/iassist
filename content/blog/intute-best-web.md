Intute was launched on 13 July 2006 at an event held at the Wellcome
Trust, London. Intute is the new face of the Resource Discovery Network
(RDN), and is a free national service enabling lecturers, researchers
and students to discover and access quality Internet resources. Intute
exists to advance education and research by promoting the most
intelligent use of the Internet.

Caroline Williams, Executive Director of Intute said, "the environment
in which we operate is rapidly changing. Issues of trust and quality are
real concerns for our users, and we have responded to this by creating a
new service which takes the best of the RDN and streamlines it into one
easy to use interface." She explains, "the Intute database makes it
possible to discover the best and most relevant resources on the
Internet. You can explore and discover trusted information, assured that
it has been evaluated by subject specialists."

Intute is hosted by MIMAS at The University of Manchester, and is a
collaboration between a whole host of partners and contributors. At the
heart of the organisation is a consortium of seven universities,
bringing together a wealth of expertise and knowledge. Intute is funded
by the Joint Information Systems Committee (JISC), with support from the
Arts and Humanities Research Council (AHRC), and the Economic and Social
Research Council (ESRC).
