A new issue of the [IASSIST Quarterly (IQ Vol. 29 issue
2)](http://www.iassistdata.org/publications/iq/iqvol29.html)is now
available on the web:

We are pleased to present this second issue of the IASSIST Quarterly
vol. 29. The issue contains three articles from the IASSIST conference
in Edinburgh in May 2005. This is a second posting of this information
as the original posting got lost in cyberspace.

At the session called "Using National Data" the paper on "[Economic
data as snapshots in
time](http://iassistdata.org/publications/iq/iq29/iqvol292stierholz.pdf)"
was presented by Katrina Stierholz from the Federal Reserve Bank of St.
Louis. The paper informs about several systems storing economic
statistics and the systems have important historical dimensions:
"Looking back at decisions made, it is important to be aware of what
the data at the time said, not what they say now".

Another session called "Discovering a Profession: the Accidental Data
Librarian" a presentation "Looking for data directions? - ask a data
librarian" was given by Stuart Macdonald (Edinburgh University Data
Library) and Luis Martinez (London School of Economics Data Library).
The article presents "[The Local Data Support Landscape in the
UK](http://iassistdata.org/publications/iq/iq29/iqvol292macdonald.pdf)"
and focuses on specialized national data centers starting a tax
assessment from 7th century, mentioning the Domesday Book from 1086, and
then moves quickly to the establishment of the start of UK Data Archive
in 1967, and the others to follow like ESDS, EDINA, MIMAS, AHDS and
several more.

"Enriching Metadata: the Lifecycle Perspective" was a session that
contained the presentation "Providing context for understanding: the
data life cycle" given by Elizabeth Hamilton from the University of New
Brunswick, Canada. The presentation is turned into the paper
"[Providing Context for Understanding: Insight from Research on Two
Canadian Health
Surveys](http://iassistdata.org/publications/iq/iq29/iqvol292hamilton.pdf)".
The conclusion is that there is a need for placing the survey data in
context including metadata from the earliest part of the data life-cycle
to give "a complete record of evolution of that question, from concept
to analysis."
