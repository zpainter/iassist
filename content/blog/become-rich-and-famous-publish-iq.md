These days many IASSIST members have received acceptance for their
papers to the upcoming conference IASSIST 2013 in Cologne. There will be
many interesting presentations at the conference. The conference
presentation is your chance to present a project you are involved in, to
air your argumentation for special areas, and in general to add to the
IASSIST knowledge bank.

Projects are typically focused on support of social science research but
the IASSIST related support now takes many forms with the developments
of technology and applications. With your presentation at the conference
you will have discussions and improvements of your work. After the
conference you can in addition to the presentation at the conference
reach a greater audience by publishing a revised paper in a coming issue
of the IQ. Articles for the IASSIST Quarterly are always very welcome.
They can be papers from IASSIST conferences or other conferences and
workshops, from local presentations or papers especially written for the
IQ.

If you are chairing a conference session you have the opportunity to
become guest editor and to aggregate and integrate papers on a common
subject for a special issue of the IQ.

Authors are very welcome to [take a look at the
instructions](http://iassistdata.org/iq/instructions-authors) and
article template on the IASSIST website. Authors and guest editors can
also contact the editor via e-mail: kbr@sam.sdu.dk.
