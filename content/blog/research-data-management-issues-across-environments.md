Lots of conversations going on these days in different venues where
people are asking many of the same questions:  how do we teach
researchers about data management with limited staff, and what data
management services should we offer?  How do we find sustainable ways to
manage data that leverage the efforts of many different repositories,
those in government, institutions and disciplinary ones?  How do we
coalesce standard practice and reasonable but effective policies at at
least the national level and preferably on a global scale?  What roles
should governments play?  How much can we as data professionals
accomplish on our own?  The Data Management and Curation SIG will host a
workshop to talk about these and other issues across different countries
and environments next Tuesday. Our speakers will include:

-   Dan Gillman, U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics
-   Marcel Hebing, DIW Berlin
-   Chuck Humphrey, University of Alberta
-   Steven McEachern, Australian Data Archive
-   Barry Radler, Institute on Aging, University of Wisconsin-Madison
-   Robin Rice, EDINA and Data Library at the University of Edinburgh
-   Kathleen Shearer, Confederation of Open Access Repositories and
    Research Data Canada

Looking forward to seeing many of you in Toronto!
