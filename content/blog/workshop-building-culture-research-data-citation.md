**Building a Culture of Research Data Citation**

Workshop at eResearch Australasia 2011

Thursday 10 November 2011: 9:00-12:30

<http://conference.eresearch.edu.au/workshops/#8>

The Australian National Data Service (ANDS) is currently developing a
service called "Cite My Data" [1], which uses the international
DataCite infrastructure [2] to support the citation of Australian
research sector datasets.  The DataCite infrastructure is built on the
Digital Object Identifier (DOI) system [3]--widely used for citation
and tracking of scholarly publications.  The ANDS Cite My Data service
will allow Australian research data publishers and users to uniquely
identify research data and cite data from publications or other datasets
[4].

ANDS is hosting a workshop at the eResearch Australasia 2011 conference
based around data citation and the Cite My Data service. The workshop is
designed for data publishers and users in the research sector who need
to gain a deeper understanding of the issues and technologies around
data citation and the ways data citation can be supported at their
organizations.

Highlights of the workshop include:

- An overview of the DataCite initiative from Jan Brase, Managing Agent
of DataCite

- An overview of ANDS services related to data citation and tracking

- A practical look at the ANDS Cite My Data service

- Experience reports from institutions currently implementing data
citation policies

- Opportunity for question and answers with key ANDS and DataCite
representatives

The workshop will be held on Thursday 10 November 2011 (during the
conference workshop days) from 9:00-12:30. Conference registration is
available at <http://conference.eresearch.edu.au/registration/>.
