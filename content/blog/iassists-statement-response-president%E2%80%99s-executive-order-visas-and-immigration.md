Statement of the International Association for Social Science
Information Services and Technology (IASSIST at
<http://iassistdata.org>) in response to President Trump's January 27
Executive Order on Visas and Immigration, titled "PROTECTING THE NATION
FROM FOREIGN TERRORIST ENTRY INTO THE UNITED STATES".

The recent executive order on visas and immigration issued on January
27th by US President Trump is of grave concern to IASSIST as an
organization. IASSIST, the International Association for Social Science
Information Services and Technology, is an international organization of
professionals working in and with information technology, libraries,
data services and research & higher education to support open science,
advocate for responsible data management and use, build a broader
community surrounding research data, and encourage the development of
data professionals. Our membership is international, and we greatly
value the ability to travel and meet to share knowledge at locations
around the world. Our international fellows program and other
initiatives are specifically designed to encourage participation from
underrepresented regions, including the Muslim-majority countries
targeted by the executive order.

While recognizing the authority of the United States over its borders,
there are several aspects of this order that are troubling, viz.:

1.  Its sudden and chaotic implementation has led to severe uncertainty
    over whether rules and practices for entering the United States will
    be subject to rapid and arbitrary change.
2.  It has led to the detention of lawful permanent residents of the
    United States, the revocation of visas previously granted under
    proper vetting procedures, the perception of potential
    discrimination on the basis of religion, and the humanitarian crisis
    caused by ceasing to accept refugees.
3.  Its introduction of several restrictive elements into the domain of
    visas and immigration, such as the statement that those entering the
    US, including temporary visitors, must "support the Constitution".

For these reasons, the order generates a hostile climate for the open,
collaborative scientific work of our organization, both for non-US
persons seeking to work and collaborate with Americans, and for
Americans traveling and working outside of the US to collaborate who may
face retributive actions from other states. Our membership has
legitimate concerns about whether travel to the US is possible under
such conditions. The order also may have long-term repercussions that
damage the reputation of the US as a location that is open to visitors
and immigrants, supporting the open exchange of ideas, and protected
under the rule of law from arbitrary changes impacting human freedom. In
response, IASSIST will continue to speak out in favor of our
organization's goals, and against such threats to international
collaboration in research and data sharing.

Our May 2017 annual conference will be held in Lawrence, Kansas.
Arrangements were begun long before the Executive Order on Visas and
Immigration, and it is impossible to change the venue at this date.
IASSIST stands in solidarity with its members and encourages them to
attend the conference and participate in the international exchange of
ideas that is the purpose of our association. We hope that no member
will be denied entry into the US due to the administration's recent
actions. IASSIST will assist its membership with visa issues and other
concerns emanating from this order. We also reaffirm that we are
committed to an environment free from discrimination, harassment, and
retaliation, at the annual conference and all IASSIST activities.
