Please join us for the Data Information Literacy Symposium at Purdue
University in West Lafayette, IN, on September 23rd, and 24th 2013. 

**Program:**  This symposium will explore roles for practicing
librarians in teaching competencies in data management and curation to
graduate students.  With support from the Institute of Museum and
Library Services, librarians from Purdue University, Cornell University,
the University of Minnesota and the University of Oregon have
investigated this topic through developing and implementing "data
information literacy" (DIL) instruction programs for graduate students
in a range of science and engineering disciplines. 

Members of the DIL project will share their experiences in working with
faculty and graduate students, with a primary focus on the practical
applications of their work.  Keynote speakers will provide additional
perspectives on teaching data literacy competencies.  A portion of the
conference will be devoted to further exploration of selected topics of
interest as determined by attendees.

**Outcomes:** Attendees will acquire an understanding of current issues
in teaching data management and curation competencies to students.  
Through presentations, discussions and hands-on activities, attendees
will develop strategies for creating their own instructional programs
suitable for the needs of their students and faculty.    

**Intended audience:** Academic librarians and others who are providing
research data management instruction for students, or librarians who are
interested in doing so. 

**Poster Session:** Attendees who have developed educational
initiatives, crafted resources, or conducted research in this area are
invited to submit materials for a poster session, which will be held at
the pre-symposium reception on Sunday, September 22nd. Attendees will be
provided with information on how to submit a poster after they have
registered for the symposium.

**Registration**: Registration for the event is now open at:

the attendance is limited to the first 80 individuals that register. 
After that, you may request to be placed on the waiting list.
