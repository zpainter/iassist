Dear IASSISTers,

Welcome to [IASSIST Quarterly Vol. 49 No. 3 <span class="fas fa-external-link-alt"></span>](https://www.iassistquarterly.com/index.php/iassist/issue/view/162).

We trust that you had a pleasant and restorative summer, and that the academic year is off to a good start.

We are grateful to the thoughtful reader or author who recently recommended IQ for inclusion in Scopus. We've received notice of this recommendation directly from Scopus. At this time, however, we have chosen to delay the review process. A successful application requires a comprehensive set of editorial and ethical policies, and we are still in the process of developing and strengthening these to meet Scopus' standards. The Editors and Editorial Board of IQ are actively working to ensure our policies not only align with Scopus' criteria but also provide a clear, consistent, and equitable experience for authors, reviewers, and readers. We will continue to share policy updates on the journal's website. We value your engagement and welcome your input and feedback.

As the research landscape continues to evolve, librarians and other data support professionals are increasingly called upon to develop tools, competencies, and services that foster transparency, usability, and accessibility in data-driven scholarship. The four articles in this issue highlight a shared commitment to empowering diverse research communities through innovative approaches to data stewardship and support. All of them underscore the importance of adaptable infrastructure, inclusive training, and responsive guidance. Together, they reflect the growing role of libraries in advancing equitable and effective research data practices across disciplines.

This issue opens with the winning submission of the 2024 IASSIST Conference Paper Competition, titled ***How are we FAIR-ing? Creating a FAIR self-assessment checklist for data repositories***, authored by **Lauren Phegley** and **Lynda Kellam**. The paper outlines an initiative undertaken by the Penn Libraries Research Data team to develop a self-assessment tool based on the FAIR Principles—Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable. This tool is designed to help data repository teams evaluate whether their repository's policies, infrastructure, and documentation support the deposit of FAIR-compliant data. The authors also discuss the intended applications of the tool and share key insights gained throughout its development.

**Meryl Brodsky** and **Hannah Chapman Tripp**, conduct a retrospective review, exploring the data-related competencies required by liaison and subject librarians to effectively support academic researchers. In their article ***Data competencies for liaison librarians: A scoping review***, the authors map data-related competencies over a ten-year period (2012-2022) with particular attention given to the skill sets that liaisons, or non-data librarians, may need to develop or hone. The study identifies key competencies that are critical for librarians supporting researchers with data-related inquiries. It underscores the importance of structured training and offers guidance on prioritizing specific skill areas.

In their article ***Adventures in data visualization support assessment: When the gap you were trying to identify turns out to be a chasm***, authors **Meg Miller**, **Grace O’Hanlon** and **Hafizat Sanni-Anibire** present findings from two studies conducted by a group of librarians at the University of Manitoba. These studies explore emerging patterns in research mobilization methods and assess the structural support needed to enhance libraries’ ability to effectively serve their users.

Authors **Alison Sizer**, **Andreas Mastrosavvas**, and **Oliver Duke-Williams** present an overview of the (U.K.) Office for National Statistics' Longitudinal Study (ONS-LS) and the unique opportunities it offers for longitudinal research on the population of England and Wales. Their article, ***The ONS Longitudinal Study – Opportunities for longitudinal research on the England and Wales population***, details the scope and content of the ONS-LS and introduces the Centre for Longitudinal Study Information and User Support (CeLSIUS), highlighting its role in assisting both current and prospective users. The article also includes a comparative analysis of the ONS-LS alongside other census-based longitudinal studies within an international context.

Enjoy the reading!
