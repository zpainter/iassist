I took a long look at **[UNData](http://data.un.org/ "UNdata")** the
other day and came away thinking "pretty; looks functional; how does it
relate to other UN products, esp. the ones we're paying for". I sent
those questions to the feedback address and Mr. Zoltan Nagy responded
with the following helpful information. Thought I'd share in case
others had the same questions...

"UNdata is the United Nations Data Access System which gives access to
current, relevant and reliable statistics for free. The service is
provided by the United Nations to users of data around the world. It
offers easy access to data compiled and produced by United Nations
agencies as well as other organizations.

 

UNdata's main features are: - accessing different data sources through
one interface, - searching data with keywords and browsing databases, -
refining search results by filtering, and - customizing tables with
features such as sorting, column selection and pivoting.

 

**UNdata and the UN Common Database (UNCDB)** UNdata is replacing the
UNCDB. The new system goes beyond the concept of the UNCDB, starting
from the way the data is stored and searched to the data presentation.
Furthermore, the UNCDB only includes a small selection of UNSD's
extensive data collection, whereas UNdata will have broader data
coverage from various international and national sources.

 

The UNCDB series are currently available through UNdata under the new
name "Key indicators". Please note that the Key indicator's scope has
already been reduced, as some of the series have been included from the
original data provider.

 

The UNCDB will be discontinued this summer after the academic year
finished in most schools around the globe.

 

**UNdata and COMTRADE** UNdata is not replacing COMTRADE. COMTRADE is a
very comprehensive database for merchandise statistics containing around
1.5 billion trade records in 7 classifications up to 6 digit level of
the classification. In addition, the COMTRADE interface offers many more
features that are specific to this large trade statistics dataset, e.g.
the search by partners and reporters to create mirror images.

 

UNdata contains only around 40 million trade records only in 2 digit HS
1992 classification and searchable only by reporters. "
