The Purdue University Libraries, partnered with the libraries of the
University of Minnesota, the University of Oregon and Cornell
University, led this project to help raise awareness of research data
management and curation issues among rresearchers, through developing
and implementing data information literacy (DIL) instruction programs
for graduate students. [The website of the
project](http://wiki.lib.purdue.edu/display/ste/Home) has gathered
updated information and development of the researcher interview
instruments, the data management training curriculum, as well as
research publications result from the project.
