By Winny Nekesa Akullo, Uganda Library and Information Associations 

I won sponsorship from the International Association for Social Science
Information Services and Technology (IASSIST) for a One-day Data
workshop conducted on 29th November 2018 at the National Library of
Uganda on behalf of the Uganda Library and Information Associations
(ULIA). The workshop aimed at bringing together librarians from
different institutions in Uganda to learn how to collect relevant and
meaningful data to tell stories relating to the Sustainable Development
Goals (SDGs). The workshop attracted 20 librarians from government
departments, academia, public and community libraries.

 

The workshop was facilitated by Dr. Sarah Kaddu, the President, ULIA and
Mr. Eric Haumba, Chief Librarian, YMCA Comprehensive Institute and
moderated by Ms. Winny Nekesa Akullo, the Publicity Secretary of ULIA,
IASSIST Event Liaison Officer and a member of IASSIST.

The workshop topics included; The UN 2030 Agenda and AU Agenda 2063; the
role of libraries in the 2030 Agenda and" Telling Your Story" Tracking
and Collection of Relevant Data Template for Documenting Stories. At the
end of the workshop participants were presented with certificates of
participations.

In his opening remarks, the Director of the National Library of Uganda,
Mr. Adonia Katungisa, noted that the workshop was timely and more
relevant to the librarians considering that the policy makers and
researchers are now demanding for data and statistics to enable them
make informed decisions and planning for the libraries in the country.
Its therefore, time for people to know what libraries are doing.

Dr. Kaddu on the other hand emphasized that as librarians, "we need to
work closely within the profession and other sectors to achieve UN 2030
Agenda", she implored the participants to use statistics to advocate for
positive change in their societies. Using relevant data is a very good
way to support our advocacy and tell our stories. There is need to
define the purpose for the data, what data do you need, where to find
the data, explain the data and connect the numbers to the story you are
trying to tell. 

Therefore, there is need to strengthen data collection, management and
dissemination to capture evidence to inform decision making.

Feedback from the participants indicated the objective of the workshop
was fully achieved and the quality of the results at the workshop was
high quality. The participants also recommended for establishment of a
database/system to collect library statistics and activities countrywide
and training in data literacy skills to ensure that data are used and
interpreted correctly.

The Participants were very enthusiastic to be part of the workshop and
also looked forward to joining IASSIST as members.

We are very grateful to IASSIST for its support without which this
workshop wouldn't have been possible.
