The IASSIST Fellows Program is pleased to announce that it is now
accepting applications for financial support to attend the IASSIST 2013
conference in Cologne [<http://www.iassist2013.org/>], from data
professionals who are developing, supporting and managing data
infrastructures at their home institutions.

It should be noted that funding is not intended to cover the entire cost
of attending the conference and that the applicant's home institution
must provide some level of financial support to supplement an IASSIST
Fellow award. Strong preference will be given to first time participants
and applicants from those countries currently with insufficient
representation at IASSIST. Only fully completed applications will be
considered. Applicants submitting a paper for the conference will be
given priority consideration for funding.

**You may apply for funding via
this[form.](http://tinyurl.com/cdsxfcd "IASSIST Fellows Application Form 2013")The
deadline for applications is the 31st of January 2013.**

For more information, to apply for funding or nominate a person for a
Fellowship, please send an email to the Fellows Committee Co-chairs,
Luis Martínez-Uribe (lmartinez@march.es) and Stuart Macdonald
(stuart.macdonald@ed.ac.uk).

If you need further information please let us know
Best wishes,

Luis Martinez-Uribe and Stuart Macdonald
IASSIST Fellows Committee Co-chairs
