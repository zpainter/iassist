Like everyone else, I've managed to catch up after being out of the
office.  But IASSIST was worth every minute!  It was a pretty jampacked
week, so I'm just getting around to blogging a few observations.

I allocated too few moments to visiting the poster sessions.  One that
intrigued me was the Digital Library Federation's American Social
History Online project, or Aquifer.  (Maybe it's the fact that I was a
history major.)  Aquifer brings together fascinating resources from over
100 digital collections, all delivered right to your desktop: sheet
music from the 19th century; a great photo of Teddy Roosevelt speaking
to members of the National Negro Business League;  portraits of the
Brooklyn Dodgers (remember them?);  a firsthand travel account of
Scandinavia from 1863; U.S. political cartoons that make current
caricatures look pretty tame.

**Do** check out Aquifer:  <http://www.dlfaquifer.org/>
