Regardless of the institutional setting in which we work, more and more
of us are having to address researcher access to restricted or
confidential datasets.  This post focuses on sessions at Stanford that
covered this important topic--or rather, group of topics because there
are so many intersecting responsibilities to actually making such
access a reality for our users.

Lisa Neider's poster session focused on the practicalities of
"Administering Restricted Data Contracts."  In particular, her handout
provided "natural language" tips when working with the agreements
required by data distributors.

I also attended Friday's paper session, "Licensing, Privacy, and
Protection. " Many of us now interact with Institutional Review Boards
(IRB) in our respective institutions.  It's not easy to balance the
needs of researchers, expectations of the IRBs, and requirements of data
collectors and distributors.  Summaries of the presentations follow.
Admittedly, they focus on the things that **I** found interesting--so
do comment on the points I've missed!

Amy Pienta (ICPSR) was unable to present in person, but session chair
Libbie Stephenson discussed the high points and forwarded Amy's
excellent handouts.  They review the many (*many*) issues involved with
data deposit and retention, ownership and distribution rights, and
respondent protection.  Although the paper focused on retention and
archiving, the more memorable elements covered information loss. A
couple chilling scenarios suffice.  An estimated 20% of data collected
with NIH funding are never archived.  Significant amounts of data are
discarded due to retention (or rather, nonretention policies) or
misinterpretation of institutional or publication guidelines.  In
particular, limited retention guidelines (such as those of APA) *appear*
to give researchers a green light to dump their data. 

Thomas Lindsay (University of Minnesota) started with an historical
overview on evolution of IRBs in the United States.  Review panels are
largely populated by senior researchers. Although they bring substantial
research experience to the table, their perspectives regarding security
measures (the "locked file cabinet" approach) reflect traditional
methodologies that don't translate completely to the digital age.  The
result of IRB deliberations is, too often, inconsistent application of
guidelines.  Such case-by-case review can inadvertently feed
investigator disillusionment with the IRB process.  Data professionals
can play an important intermediary role between researchers and panels
charged with protecting the rights of research participants. 

Libbie Stephenson (UCLA) discussed institutional review processes from
the perspective of a service that supports public-use data products. 
Based on interactions with a variety of players (data users,
researchers seeking funding, IRB members, university legal counsel
staff, and others), she's compiled an excellent resource, Guidelines
for Data Sharing and Access.  See the link from here:
