[The IMF Data
Mapper](http://www.imf.org/external/datamapper/index.php) lets you
visualize data from some of the IMF's major sources,
including[ ](http://www.imf.org/external/ns/cs.aspx?id=28)[World
Economic Outlook](http://www.imf.org/external/ns/cs.aspx?id=28), Balance
of Payment Statistics, Government Finance Statistics, AFR Regional
Economic Outlook, and Joint IMF-OECD Statistics. You can choose from
around 80 different indicators, such as GDP, inflation rate or
unemployment rate. You can display data for specific countries, regions,
or analytical groups, such as the Euro area or emerging and developing
economies.

The display includes a zoomable map of the world. If you hover over a
particular country, you will see the indicator's value for that country,
and if you click on the map, the display will zoom in. It also provides
a line and a bubble chart displaying data points over time. The data for
selected indicators can be exported to an excel file or you can export
the map and chart as picture files (in .png formats).

The help screen is limited, so you may need to play around with the
options to get comfortable with it. Overall, it is a good free source
for creating visual displays of international economic data. Take a look
