First, on January 18th, an announcement was made on
[blog.wired.com](http://blog.wired.com/wiredscience/2008/01/google-to-provi.html)that
Google will be hosting terabytes of science data.

> Sources at Google have disclosed that the humble domain,
> <http://research.google.com> , will soon provide a home for terabytes
> of open-source scientific datasets. The storage will be free to
> scientists and access to the data will be free for all. The project,
> known as Palimpsest and first previewed to the scientific community at
> the Science Foo camp at the Googleplex last August, missed its
> original launch date this week, but will debut soon.

Google may have just violated one of its operating principles, namely,
"do no harm." I am concerned that Google's treatment of data as just
another Internet commodity may undermine the work that data archivists
have been labouring over recent decades to get researchers and research
councils to take data preservation and access seriously. While the
announcement does not address Google's approach to data preservation,
it is clear that the author sees this as an open access success story.
How will data be transferred to Google?

Can we expect metadata to be *slurped* up with the data? Overall, the
Google approach simply confounds science data with other digitally
published resources, i.e., just another digital commodity. I would be
much more reassured if science data were being cared by a non-profit,
public institution. This is an issue that we should debate within
IASSIST and one that we might well have to address in the wider
scientific community. After all, Google will only succeed if scientists
give them access to research data.

The second development was announced in a [press
release](http://www.manchester.ac.uk/aboutus/news/display/?id=130085) by
the University of Manchester on January 22nd that our good friends in
MIMAS will be building an Internet search engine competitive with
Google.

Time for a rhetorical question: if the academic community can't trust
Google to deliver scholarly search results, why would this community
trust Google with research data?
