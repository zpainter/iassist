Announcement of Workshop: Providing Social Science Data Services:
Strategies for Design and Operation
<http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/sumprog/courses/0041> August 9-13,
2010 Ann Arbor Michigan

Instructors: Chuck Humphrey, Head of the Data Library, University of
Alberta Jim Jacobs, Data Services Librarian Emeritus, University of
California San Diego

This five-day workshop is being offered for individuals who manage or
provide local support services for ICPSR and other numeric data for
quantitative research.

Providing access to data has taken on greater prominence over this past
decade with the emergence of several significant developments,
including, e-Science infrastructure funding, the open data movement,
national and institutional digital preservation strategies & services,
data enclaves for confidential data, lifecycle data management planning,
and data mash-up technologies on the Internet. Given these major
environmental changes, how does one plan and design appropriate levels
of data service in her or his local institution?

This workshop is structured around a five-stage data lifecycle model
that focuses on data production, data dissemination, data repositories,
data discovery and data repurposing. A day is dedicated to each stage in
this model during which discussions address issues for local data
services and computer exercises demonstrate service activities.  In this
context, fundamental data topics are  covered, including understanding
the data reference interview, working with variables, interpreting data
documentation, coping with various dissemination formats, accessing
different online services (e.g., SDA and Nesstar), searching for social
science data, subsetting data using Web-based tools, selecting and
downloading ICPSR data, and options for local data delivery. Throughout
the workshop, an emphasis will be placed on social science concepts and
terminology, as well as on practical solutions to service delivery.

Who Should Attend: Anyone who is new to providing services for numeric
social science data or is seeking to revitalize an existing service.
This is not a course in statistics and attendees are not expected to
know how to analyze data.
