I could say this is needed because the videos and wifi weren't working,
but in fact I'd be asking anyway.

Just think how helpful it is for members who could not be with us (and
potential
members)![](/img/blog/iassist2013.jpg "IASSISTers in Koln"){width="1024"
height="768"} to get a snapshot of views about what happened. Serious,
silly, short, verbose, objective, or ridiculously opinionated
impressions of one session, the social events or overall are very
welcome.

Turn your personal notes into a gift that keeps on giving.

If you have any trouble posting (as a member) simply contact
iassistwebmaster@gmail.com and we'll sort you out.
