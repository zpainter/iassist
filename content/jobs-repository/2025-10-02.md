**Open Data and Repository Services Librarian**

The University of Maryland Libraries seeks an Open Data and Repository Services Librarian to join the Open Scholarship Services (OSS) team, inaugurated in September 2022. The Open Data and Repository Services Librarian will work within the OSS team and across the Libraries and wider campus community to provide leadership on the changing landscape of open access, open data, and scholarly communication.

The Open Data and Repository Services Librarian will provide oversight for the day-to-day operations of the Digital Repository of the University at Maryland (DRUM) and promote use of the repository by the UMD community. This may involve establishing partnerships and workflows with departments, programs, and schools on campus to regularly or bulk deposit materials and form collections within the repository. In addition to the storage and publication of scholarly literature, electronic theses and dissertations, and other UMD research community outputs, DRUM is increasingly central to the implementation of the University of Maryland’s Equitable Access Policy as well as our efforts toward greater open data production and sharing.

As technologies and research funding requirements within the academic research community are rapidly changing, the Librarian will conduct research, stay abreast of developments, and participate in discussions on our campus and in the wider community to aid the University of Maryland in developing policy and infrastructure to support students and faculty in ethical open data production and publishing open research outputs through the repository.

Working at the intersection of scholarly communications and research data, we welcome applications for the Open Data and Repository Services Librarian from early career as well as established librarians with an interest in this space and a desire to aid our community in building innovative solutions to changing research funding requirements and evolving data and metadata standards.
