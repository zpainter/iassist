**Data Acquisition Librarian**

**Position:**

This librarian position (part of the Board’s “Knowledge Analyst” job family) will join an experienced, customer-focused team of five librarians on the Board Research Library’s Data and Subscriptions Team. This team acquires data and subscription services that fuel the economic research at the Federal Reserve Board, the nation’s central bank. This librarian position blends business reference skills needed to learn about economists’ data needs and acquisition skills to coordinate negotiations for new licenses and renewals of existing licenses. The Board Research Library has 19 staff supporting the research and policy work of more than 300 economists and hundreds of analysts. This position is particularly rewarding because the data and subscriptions we acquire are used immediately to brief Board members and senior leadership of the Federal Reserve System.

 - Evaluate the research needs of economists and financial analysts to connect them to licensed economic and business data and research resources

 - Answer questions from data managers and researchers about licensed data and subscriptions and connect them to data vendor subject matter and technical experts
 - Advise stakeholders on copyright and data usage restrictions detailed in license terms and conditions
 - Represent the interests of the Board in the development of consortia agreements within the Federal Reserve System, comprised of the Board and twelve Reserve Banks
- Reviews the use of data in Board work products to ensure compliance with license terms
- Represent the Research Library on division and Board committees related to data governance, information management, and emerging technologies
- Participate in library-wide projects to enhance the library’s processes, technology, and marketing

**Required Qualifications:**

- Master’s degree in library or information science from an ALA-accredited institution, a degree in a related field, or equivalent experience

- Strong verbal and written communication skills to build relationships with internal customers, process partners, and external vendors
- Strong analytical and problem-solving skills and the ability to interpret licenses to support stakeholders’ understanding of terms and conditions
- Strong attention to detail needed to document the acquisitions process

**Desired Qualifications:**

- Experience negotiating licenses for library electronic resources such as data sets, online news, e-journal aggregators, or e-books
- Subject matter knowledge of business data resources (such as economics, finance, banking, or accounting subscription services) is preferred
- Customer-facing or reference librarian experience assisting users with discovery and use of business or economics resources
- Basic knowledge of the federal government contracting process is helpful but not required
