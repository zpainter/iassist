**Position description**

The University of Michigan School of Information seeks qualified tenure-track faculty candidates (open rank) to broaden existing scholarship within the school and the U-M community in the multidisciplinary area of archives and digital curation. Broadly construed, research in this area includes: understanding the application of digital curation technologies and methods in data repositories, archives, libraries, museums, and other knowledge organizations; the representation and interpretation of heterogeneous digital content and collections; interoperability, integrity and trustworthiness of archives and legacy data; leveraging digitized archives for community-oriented work; and data curation and digital preservation. Ideal candidates for this position will demonstrate a national profile and research portfolio that contributes to the socio-technical aspects of archives and digital curation and intersects with, and contributes to, community archives and data practices that address decolonial, anti-racist, and social justice work.

We seek candidates with strong research interest and expertise in areas such as:

- Critical archival studies that examine the representation and management of digital collections for underserved communities;
- Decolonial approaches to support community information services, relationships, usability, and accessibility of digital collections;
- Tools, techniques, and policies that leverage archival data and legacy collections to promote digital equity and address racial, political, economic, and other social inequalities;  
- Data preservation and trustworthiness over the long term, and corresponding issues regarding data uses and reuses;
- Incentives for data sharing and models for reuse of digital data;
- Ontologies and models (general and domain-specific) that make it possible to conceptualize, act, and reason about data in automated ways;
- Models and methods to extract and trace data provenance, and correspondingly, methods to use provenance in analysis, quality assessment, and reasoning about, linking, and retrieving data; and
- Ethical, policy, algorithmic, organizational, and practice-based methods to mitigate privacy and security concerns with digital legacy data.

The successful candidate should demonstrate potential for, or experience with, publication and research funding, collaborative and interdisciplinary initiatives, and working with students from diverse backgrounds. We anticipate the successful candidate will start in Fall 2024.
