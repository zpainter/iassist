5. Reports
----------

### 5.1 Report of the president (P Burnhill)

P Burnhill reported on his previous term as president. Is of the opinion
that IASSIST is doing fine, continually reinventing itself, dealing with
new opportunities to learn about the wider world. The term has yielded
some successes, some continuing, and some to be repeated. The main
successes were:

a.  the reorganization of the IASSIST Quarterly, with thanks to the work
    of M Adams, who modernized and streamlined the processes, and to J
    Statford who brought it up to date.
b.  the Treasury was modernized, thanks to the work of W Thomas
c.  Outreach Action Group, thanks to the work of I Einowski. A way must
    be found to manage and sustain this success.

Additional areas that need future attention are:

d.  regionalization - this needs rethinking, and is associated with the
    Membership Committee, under the direction of S Giles
e.  liaison and representation

P Burnhill thanked the outgoing Administrative Committee members for
their contributions: V Kvalheim, R de Vries, D Geraci, A Janda, J
Stratford.
