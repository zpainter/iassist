**Organizational Linkages Action Group**

Takes the information from the User Survey about membership in allied
professional organizations and will solicit a list of Linkage volunteers
for each relevant organization. The group will develop a formal charge
for these Linkage volunteers reflecting the goal of communicating to
other organizations what IASSIST is doing, and communicating to IASSIST
what these other organizations are doing, in areas of mutual interest.
