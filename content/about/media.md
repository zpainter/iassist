### Logo

The following logotypes are recommended for use on websites or printed materials where the IASSIST logo is needed. 

The following **guidelines** should help you: Please do not shape, rotate, stretch or distort the logo in any way or remove any contents, including whitespace or wordmark. The protected area (clearspace) around the logo should be at least the height of the "i" inside the logomark. The logo should only be placed on a white or very light background. The full name of the association must always be readable in print and online. The acceptable minimum height of the logo on a website is 80 pixels. While our default logo is very colorful, use the black or white version on layouts that are black and white only. 

Contact the Communications Committee (communications ( at ) iassistdata.org) if need a copy of our logo or if you need alternative versions of it or are unsure if your intended use complies with IASSIST's policies. We will happy to assist and provide you with a logo file that suits your needs.
