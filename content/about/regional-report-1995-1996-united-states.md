Report of the U.S. Regional Secretary

by\
Laura Guy\
Data and Program Library Service\
University of Wisconsin, Madison\
May 1996

The purpose of this report is to share members\' activites beyond the
scope of IASSIST itself, including local, national and international
activities.

-   Member Activities:\
    -   Chuck Humphrey moved down from his post on the ICPSR Council.
        Currently three members of IASSIST are on Council: Elizabeth
        Stephenson, Ann Gray, and Wendy Watkins.
    -   Wendy Treadwell continues her involvement in APDU. She completed
        Doug Mills\' term on the APDU Board from October through
        December, and was then elected to a term on the ADPU Board in a
        member-at-large position. She chairs the Conference Committee in
        this capacity. She is currently also serving on the selection
        committee for the position of Executive Administrator (which
        will include a new administrative home for APDU). She was
        Program Co-Chair of the October 1995 Conference, and continues
        in that role. Members Laura Guy (University of Wiscosin) and
        Gregory Haley (Columbia University) presented a workshop on
        International Data Resources for APDU. The day-long session was
        very well attended, and brought in a number of non-North
        American participants. Other IASSIST members, including Denise
        Lievesley, Bill Bradley, Ed Spar, and Richard Rockwell
        contributed to the success of the conference.\
        According to Wendy: \"I think you should note that IASSIST
        REALLY made its presence felt at APDU95 in very positive way.\"
    -   The ICPSR Biennial Meeting was held in early October, and was,
        as usual, well-represented by IASSIST members. Jim Jacobs (UCSD)
        and Diane Geraci (SUNY-Binghamton) delivered a workshop on
        Working with ICPSR Services and Data. Members Judith Rowe, Laura
        Guy, Gregory Haley, Ilona Einowski, Elizabeth Stephenson, Ernie
        Boyko, Chris Davis, and Andrew Beveridge also made
        contributions.
    -   Denise Lievesley, Chuck Humphrey, Jim Jacobs, and Diane Geraci
        taught in the ACSPRI 12th Summer Program in Social Research
        Methods and Research Technology at Australian National
        University in January 1996.
    -   APLIC-I (Assoc for Population Libraries/Information Centers) is
        sponsoring an Internet Room at the annual meeting of the
        Population Assoc of America (PAA) in New Orleans May 9-11, 1996.
        APLIC members will provide seminars and one-on-one training in
        use of the Internet and its resources , along with handouts and
        suggestions for PAA members on improving thier access to and use
        of the Internet once they return to their institutions. Member
        Wendy Brand (UW-Madison) will be one of the information
        specialist offering assistance/training. Member Ruth Sandor
        (UW-Madison) helped with planning and practical details.
    -   Laura Guy, University of Wisconsin-Madison, published a review
        in the Journal of Government Information (Vol. 23, No. 1) of CPS
        Utilities, produced by the Unicon Research Corporation.
    -   Lynn Ackerman has left the Data Archivist at the Population
        Research Institute (PRI) at Penn State and taken a position with
        the PA Assoc of Non-Profit Homes for the Aging as a Research
        Analyst in Harrisburg, PA. The position is more closely related
        to her Masters in Public Administration. She reports that
        she\'ll actually be using primary data now - data collected from
        the 250 members (non-profit nursing homes in PA).
    -   Member extraordinaire Judith Rowe has completed her second third
        year term on the Census Advisory Committee as well as her term
        on the Depository Library Council.
    -   The University of Pennsylvania has a campus data warehouse of
        academic information. Member Pat Hildebrand is part of a task
        force that is working on making access available through the Web
        (probably via Oracle WebServer) while maintaining the required
        security.
    -   Two IASSIST members have been elected members of the 9 person
        Steering Committee for the national State Data Center program
        under the aegis of the U.S. Census Bureau. They are Annette
        Watters from Alabama and John Blodgett from Missouri.\
        The Steering Committee will be working closely with the Census
        Bureau over the next months as budget cutbacks, electronic
        dissemination of information, and changing priorities start to
        shake the data world. They report having already begun to see
        differing points of view emerge.
    -   Member Lisa Neidert, University of Michigan, was a focus group
        participant on the Census Bureau\'s Data Access and
        Dissemination System (DADs), Washington, D.C., September
        19, 1995. She is co-organizer of a conference to be held in Ann
        Arbor this summer: \"Workshop on Using U.S. Census Data to Study
        the Elderly\", July 14-19, 1996. She also gave two talks: \"Some
        thoughts on sharing data\" Presentation made at a confrence on
        Population and Politics in South Africa, Ann Arbor, Michigan,
        February 2-4, 1995, and \"Which is the Real Archive: PSC or
        PSID\" Presentation made to the staff of the Panel Study of
        Income Dynamics, Ann Arbor, Michigan, September 26, 1995. She
        also combined the 5% and 3% PUMS to create an 8% file of
        households with a respondent of 60+.
    -   Member Tess Trost will be presenting a paper on \"Managing a
        Data Archive at Texas Tech University\" on Friday (26 April) at
        the Texas Library Association Annual Meeting in Houston. She has
        also also started to become active in the Law and Political
        Science Section of ACRL of ALA, where she reports that \"no one
        seems to knows very much about data\".
    -   Member Jean Stratford, UC Davis, continued her involvement with
        GODORT.
    -   Ann Green (Yale), Pat Doyle (Census Bureau), and John Brandt
        (University of Michigan) continue their involvement on the ICPSR
        Committee to develop a codebook DTD for SGML. The draft DTD will
        be available for review at the \'96 IASSIST Conference.
    -   Jim Jacobs and Diane Geraci, along with Chuck Humphrey, continue
        their instruction of the ICPSR annual Course on Data
        Librarianship and Data Archives.
    -   Activities of all IASSIST members at the Center for Electronic
        Records at the the U.S. National Archives and Records
        Administration.\
        -   IASSIST members at the Center for Electronic Records, U.S.
            National Archives and Records Administration have had a very
            full year since the IASSIST meeting in Quebec. Among other
            things, Center staff have been participating in Archivist
            John Carlin\'s strategic directions planning initiative. His
            new plan for the National Archives will be released in the
            summer, 1996. In addition, all staff coped with the
            uncertainties of the funding of the federal budget for FY
            96, as did all our federal colleagues. The Center\'s staff
            were placed on furlough from November 14-17, 1996. Despite
            the hiatus in our ability to do our jobs, staff received
            salary for this period. The FY 96 appropriation for the
            National Archives and Records Administration passed both
            houses of Congress and was signed by President Clinton as
            part of one of the omnibus spending bills that signaled the
            end to the first budget impasse of the fiscal year.
        -   Two of the Center\'s IASSIST members have received major
            honors during this past year. Fynnette Eaton was named a
            Fellow of the Society of American Archivists, elected chair
            of the Mid-Atlantic Regional Archives Conference, and
            selected for the 1996 Technology Excellence Award by the
            \[federal\] Interagency Committee on Information Resources
            Management for designing and implementing the Archival
            Preservation System. Mark Conrad was named a Fulbright
            Scholar in Ireland for the 1995-96 academic year. He is
            teaching archival studies with an emphasis on electronic
            records at University College Dublin. While we are at
            IASSIST, Mark will be visiting Finland under the auspices of
            the Finnish Fulbright Commission, where he will lecture on
            electronic records management at the Department of
            Information Studies at the University of Tampere,
            participate in a workshop to help faculty there add records
            management to their curriculum, and will also lecture on
            electronic records management at the Abo Akademi in Turku.
            Following this, he will spend a day at the Finnish National
            Archives, talking about electronic records issues with staff
            and then travel to Sweden where he will participate in a
            workshop on electronic records and authenticity. He also
            plans to visit the Swedish National Archives.
        -   IASSISTers were among the many visitors to the Center for
            Electronic Records in this past year. They included Denise
            Lievesley, Director of the ESRC Archives at the University
            of Essex, United Kingdom, who met with us to discuss the new
            directions of both the archival and preservation programs in
            the Center. Alan Lubanski, London School of Economics,
            visited the Center as part of his survey of North American
            data service organizations. In addition, Judith Rowe and
            Doug Mills, Princeton University and Susan Adler of Rand met
            last July at the National Archives at College Park with Tom
            Brown, Peggy Adams, and Ted Hull of the Center and Pat
            Berman, Bureau of the Census, Karl Taueber of the University
            of Wisconsin, and Eric Austin of ICPSR to discuss the fate
            of 1970 Census of Population and Housing summary tape files.
            Ken Hannigan of the National Archives of Ireland
            participated in a SAA preconference practicum the Center
            hosted in conjunction with the annual meeting of the Society
            of American Archivists.
        -   During Ken Thibodeau\'s six-month detail to the Department
            of Defense, June-December, 1995, Fynnette Eaton and Tom
            Brown each served as Director of the Center for Electronic
            Records for a three-month period. Last fall, Thibodeau,
            Brown, and Eaton visited the National Archives of Canada to
            discuss approaches to the archival administration of
            electronic records. Eaton and Brown represented the National
            Archives on the \[U.S.\] Government Printing Office\'s Study
            to Identify Measures Necessary for a Successful Transition
            to a More Electronic Federal Depository Library Program.
            Peggy Adams represented the Center at the biennial meeting
            of Official Representatives of ICPSR in October, 1995. Tom
            Brown represents IASSIST at the quarterly meetings of
            COPAFS. Tom Southerly provided this representation for the
            September COPAFS meeting. Peggy Adams was appointed to the
            SAA Awards Committee and presented the Waldo Gifford Leland
            Award at the 1995 SAA meeting. Adams, Brown, and Eaton all
            participated in the seminar on electronic records that the
            Center hosted for a group of international archivists who
            met following the 1995 SAA meeting.
        -   The Center has compiled a bibliography of publications and
            presentations by staff of the Center for Electronic Records.
            Copies are available upon request. Included from this past
            year\'s activities by the Center\'s IASSIST members are:\
            Peggy Adams\' book review of Managing Electronic Records by
            William Saffady, American Archivist, Vol. 57, Summer 1994,

            and participated on a panel at the 1995 annual meeting of
            the Society of American Archivists, \"What\'s All This About
            the Next Generation? A Practitioners\' Discussion of
            Electronic Records Issues.\" She also gave a presentation on
            electronic records for Women\'s Studies at the SAA Women\'s
            Collection Roundtable. In March 1996, Adams spoke on
            \"Adapting to New Technologies\" for the Society for History
            in the Federal Government.\"
        -   Tom Brown chaired and offered comments for a session at the
            1995 SAA meeting, \"Toto, We Aren\'t in Kansas Anymore:
            Issues of Access for Archives on the Internet.\" He also led
            a practicum on accessioning electronic records as a SAA
            meeting preconference session.
        -   Fynnette Eaton presented the keynote paper: \"Ensuring
            Access to America\'s Electronic Information\" at the 12th
            Office Information Technology Conference in Augusta, GA in
            July 1995. She talked on \"Automated Preservation of
            Electronic Records: A Case Study of the Archival

            Association) Joint Chapters Meeting in Lanham, Maryland. Her
            talk focused on the holdings and preservation activities at
            the Center for Electronic Records.
-   Issues (Ethnocentric and Others):\
    -   Attempt by Princeton administration to save operating expenses
        by eliminating Data and Statistical Services which had been
        housed for many years in the CIT facility; protests on the part
        of faculty and students as well as by such outside supporters as
        the 40 IASSIST members who signed a joint letter has resulted in
        some effort to preserve these services.
    -   U.S. Government Shutdowns and Budget Slashing
    -   Threats to NSF and General Uncertainty over Research Funding
    -   IASSIST members and colleagues from Columbia, Cornell, CUNY
        (Baruch, Queens, and CUNY Central), NYU, and Yale have
        established a regional interest group called the Tri-State Data
        Archive Planning Committee. The purpose of the group is to
        exchange information about issues such as: data rescue projects,
        online data documentation, data extract programs, and joint
        acquisitions. A test data-holdings catalog was produced by Lynn
        Jacobsen and Greg Haley at Columbia, with holdings information
        from 3 of the universities.
    -   Changes to the GPO Depository Library Program including
        increasing reliance on information provision via the Internet
        and such portable electronic media as CD\'s.
    -   Initiation of the US Census program to make extracts from an
        increasing number of their data products available from their
        home page as well as more limited programs at Harvard and the
        University of Virginia.
    -   Availability of \"home-grown\" data sets from web pages at the
        Universities of Michigan, North Carolina and Wisconsin-Madison,
        among others. (All of these efforts are publicly available,
        unlike several other efforts limited to internal users).
    -   Changes at the ICPSR: media, delivery, etc.
    -   Decreasing Budgets at all Levels.
    -   Technological changes; Impact of the increased use of the
        Internet for provision of Services.
