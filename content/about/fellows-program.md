The mission of the IASSIST Fellows Program, formerly International
Outreach, is to provide support for data professionals from countries
with emerging economies and underrepresented regions who are developing
information infrastructures regarding the use and preservation of public
and private data and implementing information policy decisions at their
home institutions. IASSIST Fellows has provided financial assistance to
over 60 conference participants from around the world since 1997.

The mission of the IASSIST Early Professional Fellows Program is  to
provide support for early career data professionals and recognize the
value of new and innovative ideas from graduates and professionals new
to data in the social sciences, who may not otherwise have the funding
to travel.

Please be aware that **funding is not intended to cover the entire cost
of attending the conference. The applicant's home institution must
provide some level of financial support to supplement an IASSIST Fellow
award**.  Strong preference will be given to first time participants and
applicants from those countries currently with insufficient
representation at IASSIST. Only fully completed applications will be
considered. Applicants submitting a paper for the conference will be
given priority consideration for funding.

» Check the [current year\'s conference
website](https://www.iassistdata.org/conferences) for information about
the conference and applying, including deadlines.

» See [Fellows application
form](https://goo.gl/forms/yttyvLUetnheZH5Z2).

For more information, to apply for funding, or nominate a person for a
fellowship, please send an email inquiry to the [Fellows
Committee](https://www.iassistdata.org/about/committees.html#iassist_fellows)
Chair: Florio Arguillas (<foa2@cornell.edu>).
