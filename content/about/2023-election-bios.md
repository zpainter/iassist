I am currently serving a second term as Vice President, where I developed the IASSIST Anti-racism Action Plan with members, and as part that effort, trialled sponsorship of diversity scholarships at ALA and ICPSR with the Executive Committee. I am grateful to all the past presidents, especially San, who has pioneered a new way to continue our beloved conferences post-pandemic, along with her other achievements.
