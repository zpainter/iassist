**IASSIST
Report of the Canadian Regional Secretary**

by

Wendy Watkins<br />The Data Centre<br /> Carleton University<br />Ottawa, Ontario

May 1995

The past year has seen Canadian institutions continuing and expanding their co-operative ventures and partnerships.  The following report is based on specific institutions per se, but rather reflects on-going and new initiatives of a national and regional nature.

National Ventures

1. CAPDU at the Learneds<br />CAPDU was held in conjunction with the Learneds in Calgary last June.  This was the second year that 
meetings were held with the Learned Societies of Canada. It was decided that this would continue in the 
future,except in those years where IASSIST was held in Canada. In this case, CAPDU will meet with IASSIST.
2. The Data Liberation Initiative<br /> Championed by the Social Science Federation of Canada,
          the Data Liberation Initiative would see Canadian
          universities entering into a partnership with Statistics
          Canada, the Depository Services Programme and government
          funders to supply publicly-available datasets to the
          academic community.  To date, all parties are
          enthusiastic.  What remains to be found are firm
          commitments to funding.
3. The ARL/GIS Literacy Project<br /> Twenty-one Canadian universities will be participating in
          Phase III of the ARL/GIS Literacy Project.  This is a
          partnership between industry and Canadian research
          libraries to provide training in GIS for information
          professionals.  Two sessions to train the trainers will
          be held in Montreal in June and Edmonton in September. 
          All that remains to be negotiated is access to the data. 
          (See above.)
4. Data Consortia<br />The 1991 Canadian Census of Population and the 1986 and
          1991 Census of Agriculture have been received and
          processed by the University of Toronto.   The agriculture
          files have been disseminated and the light is visible at
          the end of the population tunnel.<br />		  Round 2 of the General Social Survey has been
          disseminated.  In addition, the Solicitor General of
          Canada underwrote the cost of providing the Violence
          against Women Survey to all Census/GSS consortium
          participants.
5. Other Nationally-available Datasets<br /> Negotiations with the Health Canada Monitor and Price Waterhouse will likely see the Canadian Health Monitors made available for non-commercial use by Canadian universities.  Other datasets that are soon to be nationally released at no cost include:
	- The Canadian National Survey on Health and Ageing
	- Polls from Insight Canada Research (Omnibus Quarterlies from 1992 to 1994 and special polls from 1990 to 1994)
	- datasets from the Canadian Labour Market Productivity Centre
6. DSP Review<br />All Canadian government programs, including the DSP,
               were under review during the past year.  A group
               representing various types of libraries and
               including the Social Science Federation
               participated in a series of meetings that was to
               decide the future direction of the program. Thus
               far, no final report has been issued and no final
               decision has been made, although it does appear
               that the program has survived.

Regional Activities

1. ICPSR
	1. West<br />ACCOLEDS (A COPPUL Consortium of Library Electronic Data
          Services) entered year two of their federation.  They
          held their annual meeting and workshop at UBC in August.
          The workshop focused on (1) Unix tools for verifying data
          orders and (2) mainstreaming data in the library.
	2. East<br />The consortium of universities in Ontario and Quebec is
          planned to formally join ICPSR July 1, 1995.  This will
          bring the number of Canadian institutions subscribing to
          ICPSR to an all-time high.
2. CANSIM (East and West)<br /> Network access to CANSIM (Statistics Canada's Socio-
          economic Database) has been advanced on two fronts:
          UofT's EPAS client/server and Web access and UBC/SFU's
          client/server and recent Web access.  ACCOLEDS proposed
          to COPPUL directors a project to provide access to
          members through  UBC/SFU's CANSIM network server in
          November.  A more detailed proposal was presented in 
          April, and will hopefully be implemented in the next
          month or two.  EPAS is now providing service to about 10
          Canadian institutions.
3. CREPUQ (Quebec)<br />The second annual meeting of la Groupe de travail sur les
          fichiers de donnees numeriques was held at McGill with
          about twenty universities represented.  The Universite de
          Montreal and Laval are developing a joint gopher to
          assist data users.
4. Data Rescue (Alberta) The UofA Data Library participated in the data rescue of
          governmental research data emanating from 20 years of the
          Alberta Hail Study.  These are valuable data that would
          have disappeared as a result on a provincial government
          program being eliminated had not efforts been taken to
          preserve the data.
