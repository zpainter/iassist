---------------------------------------

### 3.1 Canadian Secretariate - Wendy Watkins

Brief summary of Canadian activities: Western Canadian federated
membership in ICPSR started last year, an eastern Canada federation is
scheduled to begin this year. CARL census consortia acquired census of
population 1986 & 1991, General Social Surveys, and Census of
agriculture. Work on implementation of the Data Liberation Initiative to
allow universities to afford Statistics Canada data is on-going. The
CANSIM database is now network accessible, via University of Toronto and
Simon Fraser University. Statistics Canada has a gopher, and a listserv.
Three freenets have been created, with more coming.

### 3.2 European Secretariate - Peter Burnhill

An electronic IASSIST newsletter is about to hit the net, a vehicle for
putting out reports of regional secretariats. Because IASSIST 1993 was
held in Edinburgh, Europe now has 101 IASSIST members. Questions of
sustaining this membership. 1997 conference in Odense to be held in
Denmark. Will experiment with regional meeting (1-2 days) in Europe in
October. European Union has a number of new technical initiatives which
it is promoting, and which have implications for what IASSIST is doing.
I.e. money going to libraries, but need to emphasize differences between
library bibliographic information and social science data.

### 3.3 United States Secretariat - Anne Cooper

Some have dealt with earthquakes, and major moves. All are dealing with
doing more and more with fewer resources. Activities have been mainly
educational: ALA/GODORT workshop with 20 participants. ICPSR summer
session workshop on data management in its 4th year with Jim Jacobs and
Diane Geraci teaching. Also Peggy Adams conducted a workshop for
archivists in Ireland. Workshops have also been held for records
managers. Sarah Cox is chair of ALA Committee on Copyright; Judith Rowe
is a member of the Deposity Library Council and on Census Advisory
Council.
