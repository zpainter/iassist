Membership Committee -- L Timms-Ferrara.

Membership is growing, with approximately 20% of the membership in
Europe, 20% in Canada, and 50% in the United States. Other regions are
also growing.

Publications -- W Piovesan

The committee is charged with meeting the objectives of the Association,
and considering more initiatives. The IQ is going off print, but
implementation is progressing slowly. Proof-readers making it easier for
non-English speakers to publish. Now will turn these into
reviewed/refereed journal. Should make it more attractive for members to
publish in it.

International Outreach Committee -- P Lackie

Progress over the 11 years has been impressive. Now it is time to
rethink the objectives of this committee -- outreach may no longer fit
current climate. Members are encouraged to contribute any ideas.

Nominations & Elections Committee -- E Boyko

2009 is an election year. Per the constitution, half of the regional
representatives are to be elected for 4 year term, as well as regional
secretaries and the executive. It is time to think in terms of renewal.
Will put together a summary of what the positions responsibilities are.
In September there will be a call for nominations on the listserv. In
order to participate, members need to have paid dues by Jan 2009. The
election will use an electronic election service. By January, the
Committee with have a slate of candidates. The election itself will be
held in the first two weeks of February. Please think in terms of
nominations & ideas. Self-nomination is completely fine.
