### Regional Secretary (Africa)

#### Winny Nekesa Akullo

Winny Nekesa Akullo is a Records Manager at National Social Security Fund – Uganda. IASSIST has been an invaluable community for her, fostering professional growth, collaboration, and access to global expertise in data services and information technology. IASSIST represents a platform for learning, networking, and contributing to the advancement of research and open science globally. 

If elected as the  Regional Secretary – Africa, she will enhance regional representation by advocating for greater  participation from Africa and other underrepresented regions, ensuring diverse voices are included in global discussions. She will continue promoting capacity building through workshops, training sessions/webinars, and knowledge-sharing initiatives equipping  with advanced skills in data management and research. She will also foster collaboration across Africa and beyond, uniting professionals from various disciplines to address regional/global challenges in social science data management.

### Regional Secretary (Asia/Pacific)

#### Sam Spencer

Sam Spencer is CEO and co-founder of Aristotle Metadata and leader in government data management and data governance. Through the development of Aristotle Metadata Registry, Sam has worked on a range of data initiatives across the Australian government, providing input ranging from broader data policy to the development of local metadata teams within departments. Prior to this, he was an experienced public servant with experience across a range of agencies and portfolios including health, statistics and policy. This experience helped him see a market need for user-friendly, standardised metadata tools to help governments improve how they manage their information. Sam is a recognised leader in data management, having presented research on data standards and solutions at conferences in Australia and internationally. His personal goal is to demystify data management and aims to make metadata more accessible to everybody.

Sam feels his experience in the public sector working as a data manager has translated to developing a growing international software business that is changing how organisations approach data management. As a company founder, part of his role is marketing why data management and metadata are important skills that organisations must invest in. This has led to the development of number methodologies for breaking down and making metadata more approachable. He intends to bring this skillset to the committee of IASSIST to ensure that the association is on the forefront of data accessibility and governance.
