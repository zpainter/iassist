### Interest Group on Human Subjects Review Committees and Privacy and Confidentiality in Research

This group will focus on issues related to conducting research using
human subjects in the social sciences. Particular areas of focus and
discussion will include, but are not limited to the following:

-   The role and function of the human subjects review board as social
    science research enters the digital age.
-   The human subject review influences and effects on data management,
    dissemination, curation and preservation practices.
-   Issues related to protection of human subjects laws and policies
    established in IASSIST member countries.
-   Issues related to privacy and confidentiality of human subjects in
    research.

We will seek out and take advantage of opportunities for education,
outreach and advocacy on subjects related to human subjects review
committees, including proposing sessions with rele vant presentations at
IASSIST conferences and creating web based resources and tools for
members.

### The 2009 Conference

Session D3
**The Ideal IRB: Perspectives on Researchers, Institutional Data
Archives and Professional Data Organizations**
Chair: Thomas Lindsay (University of Minnesota)

In four presentations, this session will address issues with respect to
how IRB's (Institutional Review Boards) affect the data
gathering/sharing/preserving practices of researchers; understanding how
IRB's view their role in overseeing the re-use of social science
researchers and how this affects institutional repositories such as
ICPSR; and finally, we will review issues addressed in the first two
presentations, highlight how some organizations are responding, and
introduce a newly formed IASSIST IRB Interest Group. We plan on opening
up the floor for discussion on next steps.

### The 2010 Conference

Session E3
**Panel: Confidentiality and Access Concerns of the Social Sciences and
Human Subjects Ethics Review Boards**
Chair: Thomas Lindsay (University of Minnesota)
Moderator: Libbie Stephenson, Social Science Data Archive, University of
California, Los Angeles

In the United States and elsewhere, the need for ethics review was
addressed in response to egregious ethical violations in medical and
biological research. Research review in the social and behavioral
sciences has slowly evolved from this medical background, but several
contentious issues remain in the effort to best address the needs and
risks of social science data collection, analysis, and archival. This
panel will be structured to bring together various stakeholders in the
ongoing worldwide discussion of ethics review in the social sciences to
discuss current needs and future directions in the United States and
elsewhere. This session will be structured as a panel discussion and not
as a series of presentations. Each panelist will be given a chance at
the beginning to describe his or her viewpoints regarding the current
state of regulation, data access and confidentiality in social science
research. However, a moderated discussion centered around issues of data
accessibility, confidentiality, regulatory development, and the roles of
data archives, to name a few, will comprise the bulk of the session.

The first panelist, Arja Kuula (Finnish Social Science Data Archive,
University of Tampere), will describe the standpoints and the scope of
the Finnish ethics review system, which differs from the U.S. system.
One of the goals of the Finnish system is to find a balance between
confidentiality and the openness of science and research. In addition to
informing about the ethical norms that relate to data archiving, Arja
will tell how the Finnish Social Science Data Archive has been involved
in making guidelines for ethics review at the University of Tampere.

The second panelist, Robert Downs (Columbia University), will present on
the perspective that the IRB takes on data management when reviewing
research protocols for the protection of human subjects and discuss ways
in which these issues can be addressed. He will also discuss some
challenges that the protection of human subjects presents to researchers
and archives for the collection, management, and dissemination of data.

The third panelist, Yasamin Miller, will speak on the current state of
ethics review and how it should and will change in the future. Yasamin
will also provide perspectives, concerns, ideas, etc. from the human
subjects review board/IRB side of the table.
