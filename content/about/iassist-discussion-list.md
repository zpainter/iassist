**discuss@lists.iassistdata.org** (former IASST-L@lists.columbia.edu)
is an email discussion list for IASSIST members. Everyone with a current
membership and for whom we have an email address, and an indication that
you wish to join the list, is registered on this distribution list.

This service was created to facilitate communication among IASSIST
members between annual conferences. The format of this distribution list
is similar to other professional newsletters. We want to share career
opportunities, conference announcements, important dates, workshops and
training programs, minutes from IASSIST meetings, reports from
committees and action groups, news items about members, and information
from other professional associations.

The list has also become an important source of support for members to
query other data professionals about data sources and best practice in
serving users.

We are currently in the process of tranferring our discussion list to a
new host. Instructions will be updated shortly. In the meanwhile, please
contact the [List Moderator](https://iassistdata.org/about/web-team) if
you have any questions. Older instructions for using the list is at
<https://lists.columbia.edu/mailman/listinfo/iasst-l> and information on
accessing the archives is available at our membership site
[iassistdata.info](http://www.iassistdata.info).

As a non-profit organization, the resources of IASSIST, including its
discussion list, are not to be used for commercial purposes including
advertizing or other promotional efforts related to commercial products.
IASSIST Policy does permit, however, the use of its discussion list for
announcements of the availability of new datasets from members'
institutions and conferences for other organizations. IASSIST Policy
does not permit the use of this service by, or for, non-members.
