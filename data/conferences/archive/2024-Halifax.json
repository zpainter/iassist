Data support professionals need to be ready to not only deal with technical and procedural needs of our patrons, but also address topics such as biases in algorithms, equitable access to resources, and the many layers of security and privacy issues inherent in research data - and all for a dramatically diversifying clientele. As the needs for our services are expanding it is important to be mindful of factors such as; transparency, culture, the changing needs of academic disciplines, accessibility differences, promoting social justice, and breaking down barriers for a more inclusive next generation of data professionals – all while working within our budgets, of course. In this panel discussion, we will share our insights for sustainability in striving to deliver more equitable, accessible, and representative data services. We also seek input on a draft scheme to re-chart data service frameworks and training for greater inclusivity. Join us in navigating the new frontiers of data services, where inclusivity is not just a goal but a fundamental principle for the future of data-driven decision-making.",

It can be multifaceted and complex based on the types of data you are curating and the expertise of the curator; and with evolving data sharing practices and standards, ensuring data curators and stewards have access to high-quality instruction on specific data types is essential for supporting the goals of data sharing. Duke University, in collaboration with members of the Data Curation Network (DCN), received an Institute of Museum and Library Services (IMLS) grant [re-252343-ols-22] to support the development of specialized curriculum for data curation training for academic library and archives staff. The project drew together data curators and information professionals to create in-depth training resources for four specialized data types: geospatial data, scientific images, code, and simulations. Building upon the CURATE(D) workflow, the project employed a community-driven cohort approach to develop the new curriculum materials, which were piloted at a 2-day in-person workshop in October 2023. In this presentation we will discuss how this curriculum complements existing DCN training initiatives, the approach to curriculum development, the core content that was developed, plans for dissemination, and reflections on the project.",

All researchers who apply for grants to fund data-related research must now meet requirements including writing Data Management Plans and preparing data for deposit. In response to both this and the growing movement towards open scholarship and open data, a variety of Open Educational Resources (OER) were developed by several Canadian institutions to respond to local RDM training needs for researchers. At the same time, national collaborative projects were developing and growing in number. Members from these groups met to discuss how to bring together these projects, raise awareness and leverage the work that’s been done and bring it to a wider audience. This led to the idea of bringing together OER creators and contributors in a webinar series that showcases the works themselves, but also touches on how these resources may be deployed locally, re-used, re-mixed, cited, and attributed. This series is hosted jointly by the Digital Research Alliance of Canada and the National Training Expert Group. In this presentation, we will explore the lessons learned to date from this series, discuss challenges and opportunities that have arisen, and speak to future directions in national training initiatives and OER support.",

Data curators are largely in uncharted waters as to what extent repositories are able to manage ML objects and components (data, code, parameters, documentation, etc.) in a way that matches researcher needs and uses. But before we can plot a course towards a set of best practices, we must first ask: where are we now? This presentation will provide an overview of a recent research project that assessed how well metadata schema and fields in eight generalist (Figshare, Zenodo, Harvard Dataverse, etc.) and specialist repositories facilitate findability, interoperability, and reusability of ML objects. We will discuss strengths of and opportunities for these repositories, and what generalist repositories can learn from specialist repositories and vice versa. The presentation will also summarize the outputs from this project, all of which are publicly available: a multi-repository metadata field crosswalk, complete metadata exports of nearly 20,000 ML-related items from these repositories, and user interface and code to query repository APIs and standardize and analyze metadata exports. We hope the IASSIST community will dive deep into this bounty of (meta)data!",

Data depositors often provide insufficient metadata, compelling data repository staff to extensively enhance the metadata. This process traditionally involves navigating a wide array of controlled terms, a task demanding substantial time and expertise, sometimes necessitating the creation of new terms. Addressing these challenges, we introduce an innovative model employing Generative AI technology (ChatGPT). This tool is engineered to significantly diminish the time required for metadata curation for data repository staff while enhancing the accuracy of term matching. It achieves this by rapidly analyzing text and extracting pertinent keywords from established thesauri, including ICPSR, ELSST, and Library of Congress, along with ChatGPT's intelligent recommendations. This approach not only expedites the curation process but also ensures heightened precision and recall in the results.",

We present insights from 20 semi-structured interviews of secondary data users about data search, reuse, and recommendation. We conducted interviews as part of a larger study for a National Science Foundation (NSF) funded project. Academic literature shows varied data discovery practices among scientists are the norm (e.g., Gregory et al., 2020). Our NSF-sponsored work (Lafia et al., 2023; Million et al., in review) confirms this finding, but much less understood is how inter-dependencies among information needs, data types, and user contexts (to name a few factors) create variable data discovery behaviors (and why). We classify interviews using a structured codebook (Saldaña, 2011) to understand why data discovery at ICPSR is varied. Our interviews related to data discovery behavior from a variety of angles. Our presentation focuses on the search process (i.e., looking for data to meet an information need) and data reuse (i.e., processes after users find relevant data that may lead them to search for additional data or information to complete a study). We show how our interview passages align with search paths we previously identified (Lafia et al., 2023) and that considerations tied to doing research produce variability in data discovery. We conclude data discovery occurs in an ecosystem extending beyond individual data archives and repositories, which further increases variation in discovery behavior.",

Initially created with the support of a National Science Foundation grant in 1999, the Bibliography captures and documents the usage of ICPSR data in research and publications. It helps people discover data and gauge its potential utility. Now housing over 110,000 data-linked citations, the Bibliography’s database continues to be expanded by librarians and information professionals who actively fish through research output, both published and unpublished, to find instances of ICPSR data usage. If a publication meets the Bibliography’s collection criteria, the publication is displayed with the research study’s record on ICPSR’s websites. By equipping people with a compass to discover and evaluate the value of the thousands of social science datasets held by ICPSR, the Bibliography provides “wealth from the sea” of data. Attendees will enjoy engaging narratives and visual presentations that include insights about the ICPSR collection as reflected in the data-related literature. Topics covered will include (1) a look at the variety of venues where that literature is published, (2) analyses of changing data citation conventions, (3) comparisons between peer-reviewed and gray literature, including the increasing use of preprints, and (4) tales of datasets that are used in tandem to support interdisciplinary research. Attendees will come away with an appreciation of how a curated collection of data-linked publications can act as a dataset, itself, providing data users with insight while navigating the vast waters of social science scholarship.",

Geographic Information System services have existed in academic libraries for decades. Map and cartography divisions have existed in libraries for centuries. The provision of geospatial data expertise and assistance in libraries is nothing new. How the services are provided and the degree of expertise and breadth of materials (paper maps, digital data) made available is constantly evolving. The shifts that we are living in right now, with regard to how designers are educated and how scholars do scholarly work are not a gradual evolution but are instead punctuated tectonic shifts irrevocably altering the world in which we work. This presentation will weave together the practical experience of multiple dramatically different projects, their technical requirements, their scholarly contributions, and their indications of the future of geospatial work in libraries.",

This panel will present results from the Realities of Academic Sharing (RADS) initiative, a mixed-method study across six US Research Universities. Through surveys of and interviews with institutional administrators and federally funded researchers, we assessed engagement with data management and sharing (DMS) activities and the costs associated with this work. We found that institutions support a broad range of DMS activities, and invest an average of $750,000 annually in this support, with the highest costs falling on IT and Libraries. Researchers also engage with DMS activities, although many do so without institutional support. This panel will consist of separate presentations on the various facets of our results, focusing on four different institutional perspectives. First, we will discuss the Libraries, which support the majority of DMS activities across institutions, and bear some of the highest costs for DMS support. Secondly, we will highlight the support and expenses of other administrative offices such as Institutional Technology, Research Offices, and Specialized Centers. These offices are often overlooked as primary DMS service providers, but support a substantial number of DMS activities and bear considerable infrastructural costs. Thirdly, we will present the results for researchers, who spend an average of nearly 6% of their grant award totals on DMS activities, with this value more than doubling for smaller grant awards. Although most report engaging in DMS without institutional support, we found some evidence of cost-savings for those who did engage institutionally. Finally, we will discuss implications for practices and data-informed responses at the individual institution level, as well as invite collaboration in future research to broaden and diversify the institutions represented in this initial study.",

Undergraduate students also work with data within the research process, and it can be a core experience to prepare for future education and careers. Research products from undergraduate students can also demonstrate the extent of their data literacy skills and understanding, which are becoming central to success in graduate work and the business world. Since one main way undergraduate students share research is through posters, this session will examine undergraduate posters in the context of data literacy skills. During the session we will define data literacy and discuss why it is important for undergraduate students to develop. We will review the structure of undergraduate poster competitions and other opportunities for undergraduate research. Finally, we will share results on the strengths and gaps in data literacy, followed by suggestions for supporting and encouraging undergraduate research and data literacy development beyond the traditional area of data analysis.",

While discussions around data literacy in the workforce focus on its critical role in revenue and competitive advantage for companies, it is equally vital for the professional success of students and alumni. The value of data literacy skills extends beyond performing job tasks, impacting various facets of individuals’ professional lives, including job satisfaction, salary, retention, mental well-being, and job placement. However, both companies and employees, and subsequently our students, face challenges in navigating pathways to data literacy. The increasing demand for improving data literacy aligns well with the core values of librarianship, which emphasize lifelong learning and the empowerment of individuals to work effectively with information and data. Librarians in academic settings have a distinct role in teaching data literacy by collaborating with teaching faculty, campus administration, and industry professionals to equip undergraduates with essential data literacy skills before graduation. In this presentation, we will share our seven proposed business data literacy competencies, demonstrate their alignment with the ACRL Framework, and present findings from a research survey exploring the relationship between data literacy competencies taught in the classroom and professional workplace practices. These findings illustrate how the proposed business data literacy competencies move from the undergraduate classroom into the workplace and provide additional context for integrating data literacy instruction alongside information literacy. This presentation will help the audience appreciate ways in which improved data literacy contributes to success in the workplace and strengthens our workforce's capabilities.",

However, reproducibility entails transparency and openness which many find challenging as they can make researchers feel vulnerable; being clear about what you have done and why, opens the door to criticism, imposter syndrome, unethical or competitive behaviour and even professional disadvantage. Vulnerability is not easy for anyone but for most the discomfort is generally resolved through experience. However, researchers from marginalised or historically excluded groups will experience the vulnerability in very different ways which go beyond discomfort through to fear and genuine problems. For these researchers, the vulnerability and fears associated with reproducibility can be a very real barrier that prevents already disadvantaged researchers from participating that causes problems when they do participate. These researchers cannot assume that they will enjoy the benefits of established reputations, peer solidarity, or supportive management and instead may feel deliberately excluded from and disadvantaged by research practices that demand reproducibility. This presentation explores the barriers faced by researchers in efforts to be more reproducible, how those barriers may be unevenly distributed, and how research institutions and cultures can make these barriers better or worse. The presentation concludes by arguing that those calling for more transparency, openness and/or reproducibility must consider how the vulnerability and barriers entailed may not be equitably distributed and that they should be advocating for changes that allow everyone to participate in reproducible practices without exposing themselves to unfair risk.",

In Canada, the Tri-Agency’s RDM Policy prompted changes to their Policy Statement on Ethical Conduct for Research Involving Humans, enabling “broad consent” for data sharing. Across the border, the National Institutes of Health and National Science Foundation are enacting new protocols for data management and sharing. While sensitive data management is an active discussion in academic circles, researched communities are not yet included. Community organizations collect and manage data and often act as intermediaries in human-participant research that produces sensitive data but do so in different ways than university researchers. These groups and their constituents stand to benefit from guidelines to help alleviate over-research, surveillance, and damage-centered narratives. Our IASSIST presentation will discuss insights and strategies gained from the RDM Community Data Toolkits Workshop on March 21-22, 2024. This two-day event will bring together researchers and information specialists alongside social justice organizations and non-profits to develop toolkits to better navigate the critical ethics of community research data. Discussions will ensure: • Data can be utilized by communities themselves in ways that serve their specific targets and metrics for change as conceived by their own determinants of need and designs for betterment. Community-led data practices empower and support community-led grassroots actions and initiatives. • Research data from communities is protected and does not make them vulnerable and/or grant them visibility, safeguarding their susceptibility to data misuse and exploitation. With the community-engaged interventions we hope to establish a framework to continue working on these toolkits beyond the workshop. By sharing these insights with the IASSIST community, we hope to assist researchers and information specialists who may also be working with community data and/or organizations, as well as find potential collaborators on future projects following this theme",

However, some countries are more successful than others in harnessing the power of indigenous knowledge in the fight against climate change and environmental sustainability. One of the factors behind this disparity is effective data management practices. While efforts have been made to document indigenous knowledge, a lack of indigenous data sovereignty and indigenous data governance framework often means that the right data are not collected, or the collected data are not properly utilized in a way that benefits both the local community and the larger society. This often results in poor approach to indigenous data collection, development of culturally insensitive policies, and failure to secure the buy-in of local people in environmental sustainability projects. This article, therefore, explores the role of indigenous data management in environmental sustainability efforts in Nigeria. Specifically, the study examines the role of data governance practices in enhancing the preservation of indigenous knowledge relating to environmental sustainability and fostering community-led initiatives for environmental conservation. The article aims to propose an indigenous data governance structure for Nigeria to facilitate indigenous data sovereignty, which ensures that indigenous people in Nigeria are fully involved in making decisions about what data is collected and how such data is used. It is expected that promoting effective indigenous data governance and data sovereignty will lead to the development of policies and initiatives that will enjoy the support of local people and ensure the success of environmental sustainability efforts in Nigeria.",

The UKDS is a key part of UK research infrastructure, and provides a wide range of social sciences, humanities, and economic research data with census data being one of the major collections. A range of tools have been developed within UKDS to provide access to data, and these continue to be extended. New workflows exist for aggregate data and for origin-destination data – the latter being addressed in detail in a separate submission to this conference. In this paper we illustrate the full set of current tools, explain how they can be used, and showcase examples of analysis. Census data are disseminated with a variety of license arrangements: open, safeguarded, and secure, and we reflect on shifting balances of risk appetite, and what this means for researchers, including those based outside the UK. We also reflect more broadly on long-standing and new challenges faced in disseminating this data: the size and complexity of the resulting outputs; user expectations; new competitors etc. The 2021 census round in the UK was notable for a number of reasons: operational changes enforced by the covid-19 pandemic including deferment in Scotland, new questions and legal challenges to question and guidance wording. The wider context is a public consultation over the future of population and migration data collection in the UK, with the possibility that the 2021 census will also turn out to have the last such census, and thus we also reflect on how we can adapt a census archive/service to a future 'administrative based census' archive/service, with more frequent data about which researchers may be less aware.",

The reasons are simple. First, given publications disseminate knowledge within fields of inquiry, the author/creator metatdata associated with the works provide rich snapshots of persons working within the field. Second, holdings of different types of libraries within a country (i.e., national libraries, research libraries, public libraries, etc.) over time reflect changes in the acquisition policies, and preferences and demographic characteristics of their users. Gender-diversity in library collections helps expand viewpoints, promote dialogue and advance research. Our paper mines OCLC’s Worldcat metadata to explore how publication and acquisition patterns have evolved for materials created by authors of different genders over time, and across fields and different types of libraries within and across countries. This is accomplished by applying tools to infer genders of authors for materials in our sample, and combining this information with: (1) country of publication, (2) field of inquiry identified using the records’ classification codes, (3) date(s) of publication, (4) language(s) associated with the works and their translations, and (5) the number of libraries by major type in different countries holding the material within their collections. Metrics created from this analysis help answer the following questions. First, how has the gender composition of publications across fields changed over time on a global scale, and at a country level? and second, how well do the different collections of various library-types reflect the diversity of the materials available? The investigation should provide important insights into the current level of diversity reflected along this dimension by different library types across countries, and identify gaps in coverage.",

A prior study conducted by the authors of this presentation identified that many restricted data sources do not make use of metadata to ensure their data are findable and accessible. Methods To assess the readiness of restricted data sources to utilize a metadata standard, this study identified common elements of both dataset descriptions and access requirements/procedures across 48 restricted health data sources. These elements were subsequently mapped to current metadata standards (e.g. DataCite) to determine how closely they matched the elements in these existing standards. Results Our findings indicate that many restricted data sources already provide dataset information that aligns closely with existing metadata standards, that data sources would benefit from adopting metadata standards to improve the discovery of their data, and that generally, it would be possible for these data sources to adopt an existing common metadata standard to describe their data. Access information provided by these data sources, however, is not adequately supported by existing standards. To ensure that the access requirements/procedures needed to acquire restricted datasets can be discoverable and transparent, metadata standards bodies will need to revise their schemas to include more descriptive access information. This revision would also provide researchers – who collect restricted data and must comply with funder and publisher data sharing policies – with standard guidelines for describing their data access request processes in more detail. Conclusion This presentation will discuss our findings in detail, articulate key challenges in assigning metadata to restricted data, and suggest recommendations for improving the discovery of and access to restricted data.",

It is a UK leader in a broad range of disciplines with 99% of research as world leading or internationally excellent (REF 2021). Its Library is part of the network of Research Libraries UK (RLUK), boasting significant unique digital assets, including an Open Access institutional repository (research outputs repository, thesis repository & research data repository), as well as Northern Ireland Official Publications Archive (NIOPA) with de facto legal deposit status. As an institution, we must address a litany of issues and obstacles faced in the governance, maintenance, security and preservation of this unique digital data. This includes preservation formats for content in these repositories, the challenges of structured versus unstructured data, anticipated moves to cloud-based solutions and different repository vendors, funder mandates to preserve and share data, & data access committees and governance for controlled/restricted data. This paper outlines the various attendant problems, the current state of play and necessary contexts (e.g. FAIR, Open Access, funders & legislation) and asks the questions ‘Who is the making the call on vital decision making about unique assets?’, ‘Collectively, are we informed enough to do this?’, ‘What is the necessary governance and infrastructure?’ and ‘Are we ready to face an uncertain future where the stability and permanence of digital assets may be hampered by indecision, data loss, confusion, obfuscation and the unpredictability of digital data now and into the future?' This paper argues that since national/international agreement about some good practices are formative, principle-based or not fully understood or applied (e.g. FAIR data & preservation formats) it is even more imperative that partnership, collaboration and discussion happen at both micro and macro levels to harness the security, access and longevity our unique digital data collections.",

Increasingly, researchers are turning to geospatial data sources to measure these phenomena. Researchers exploring social science questions about place are experts in their fields, but may be novice users of GIS tools and technologies. They may face many challenges when working with geospatial data, including: lack of access to geospatial datasets, a need for large amounts of storage space and computing power, and a steep learning curve for the tools and programming languages used to work with geospatial data. The National Neighborhood Data Archive (NaNDA) aims to address these challenges for users in the United States by providing geographic information in a simpler, easy-to-use, and publicly available format. NaNDA is an open data repository. It was created to facilitate research on the relationship between neighborhoods and health, especially within the context of large federally funded surveys and cohort studies. NaNDA reduces barriers to incorporating spatial data into social science research in three ways. First, NaNDA makes the data available in familiar tabular formats that can easily be linked to other data sources about individuals and communities. Second, NaNDA data promotes reproducibility and speeds up the research process by making the finished version of measures available instead of multiple users having to create the same measures from scratch. Third, NaNDA data is both publicly available for anyone to download from ICPSR, and increasingly available at the point of use in other enclaves, such as the Michigan Center on the Demography of Aging (MiCDA) and the Michigan Medicine DataDirect portal. For these reasons, NaNDA serves as a model for geographic data services of the future.",

In light of the fragmentation of the open-science ecosystem, a community-based coordinated approach is necessary to ensure PIDs for facilities and instruments are adopted in ways that provide the widest benefits to everyone involved in the research landscape. It is particularly important for the social and geospatial data communities to participate in this effort as social and geospatial researchers increasingly collaborate with colleagues in the natural sciences to generate and use complex datasets produced by capital-intensive facilities and instruments. This presentation will introduce findings from the first year of activities conducted by the FAIR Facilities and Instruments project (funded by the American National Science Foundation’s FAIR Open Science Research Coordination Network) to bring together communities from a range of disciplines and roles and to identify use cases such as allowing facilities and instruments to be connected to other entities like data sets, researchers, organizations, articles, grants, and more. Activities included multiple online focus groups with various communities and an in-person workshop that convened experts from around the USA to discuss motivations for and barriers to PID adoption, as well as realistic near-term actions to pursue. Project findings to date represent an important step on the path to incorporating facility and instrument PIDs into the wider data ecosystem and developing community-based recommendations and best practices for research transparency and reproducibility in the next generation of interdisciplinary geospatial and social scientific research.",

This has culminated in Wilkinson’s et al (2016) guidelines for FAIR data. As these calls for reproducibility and FAIR data are codified in data policies and publishing ethics, it raises difficult questions for qualitative researchers for how transparency can be consistently and ethically demonstrated within their projects. Using observations and findings from a systematic review of over 1000 qualitative collections held at the UK Data Service, this presentation presents an archive’s point-of-view of how innovative ways of documenting data and new curation tools can provide support for demonstrating process and analytic transparency in qualitative research. I outline key ways that good practices in data management and curation support transparency, as well enhanced ways that go further in showing research integrity. As part of this discussion, I introduce exemplary case studies from the UK Data Service’s collections and qualitative-specific tools developed at the UK Data Service which exemplify the core principles of transparency and reproducibility in qualitative research. Reflecting on the recent developments in curation, this presentation offers qualitative researchers new possibilities for constructively responding to calls for reproducibility, as well as providing further guidance on how policies and procedures might take into account the specific needs of qualitative data.",

The increased availability of these data has facilitated vital research that can benefit our society. But these data come with risk and a TREs role is to mitigate this. Previously much of the focus of our data governance has been on preventing the re-identification of data subjects, maintaining an excellent track record in confidentiality breaches. However, in recent years we have seen the data landscape changing rapidly, with a wide array of new data types and analytical methods. This changing landscape brings new possibilities for harms which extend beyond simple re-identification. With this changing landscape, it’s time to re-evaluate our data governance to ensure we can continue to protect those who trust us with their data. This presentation will focus on work at TREs such as the Secure Data Center in Germany to review, re-evaluate and improve our data governance frameworks. This work utilises the Five Safes framework to steer the development of technical infrastructure, new training and the redefining of projects to ensure that we can ensure safe and ethical data use in a changing world.",

This legal basis should also cover the archiving and publishing of research data once you are done. Usually, the data is only released for secondary use after it has been anonymized or de-identified in some way. When talking about personal data one legal basis is informed consent. According to the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) this consent is one out of six possible legal bases for processing personal data. It is frequently used in social science research in Germany and other European countries. But there are several ethical and legal issues concerning the relation between informed consent and data archiving and publishing. Every now and then data repositories or data archives like GESIS are faced with cases of dubious consent caused by for example insufficient information. For example, in some cases it is unclear whether the data can be made available for re-use at all. In other cases, researchers relied on a fieldwork company to take care of consent and research participants are only presented with general information about the data collection. In yet other scenarios researcher think that consent would only cover the processing during the project phase. In the latter case ‘anonymizing’ the data is believed to move the data beyond any legal or ethical restriction. Is it necessary to inform research participants in advance about the future use of their data after a project has ended? If no, why not? If yes, why is it not done regularly? In my talk I will give an overview of these challenges and discuss possible solutions.",

The significance of tactile maps extends beyond mere navigation; they empower visually impaired people with greater independence and confidence in exploring new environments. This capability is particularly vital in urban settings (such as a campus), where complex layouts can pose significant challenges. At Toronto Metropolitan University (TMU) Libraries, we have initiated and built upon an existing innovative process for creating tactile maps, addressing the unique needs of the visually impaired community. This presentation will outline the process for tactile map creation, highlighting the steps involved from data acquisition to the production of the final tactile map. We will also discuss the software used, the analytical methods employed, and the considerations necessary for creating effective tactile maps. Finally, we will propose a focus group approach to refine this process, ensuring the tactile maps produced are not only accurate but also user-friendly and practical for the intended audience. Through this presentation, we hope to share our insights and methodologies, contributing to the broader efforts in making spatial information accessible to all.",

A primary purpose of these decennial censuses – to serve as a basis for calculation of resource allocation across areas – has remained, but the data collected has grown in detail complexity, giving a richer population profile snapshot. The most recent E&W census, in 2021, may be the last if the government deems alternative, more cost-effective and/or accurate methods of data collection are available. See https:\/\/consultations.ons.gov.uk\/ons\/futureofpopulationandmigrationstatistics\/ Ending census data collection would affect the future of E&W’s largest longitudinal nationally representative data resource, the Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study (LS). The LS comprises linked census and life events data for a 1% sample of the population of E&W from 1971 onwards, with individuals of all ages becoming members if they have one of four undisclosed birthdays. It enables researchers to track members over the life course, discovering the impacts of an individual’s personal, social and environmental circumstances on their outcomes, including changes in their travel to work. How we travel is inextricably linked to human and wider planetary health. Understanding what steers individuals’ travel behaviours in future is central to informing transport policy that will protect human health through, for example, climate change adaptation and pandemic preparedness. In our dual roles as members of the Centre for Longitudinal Study Information and User Support (CeLSIUS) team, and as researchers, we demonstrate the power of the LS, presenting our ongoing investigation of commuting behaviour and associated factors – such as self-rated health, socioeconomic status, length of commute, residential and workplace stability, and neighbourhood walkability – among LS members. We highlight the implications of the proposed cessation of the census and discuss data sources needed to interpret future commuting habits.",

My attempt at an ‘inside-out, multi-level’ account of the Before made extensive use of the search facilities available in ‘subscription access’ genealogy websites, having abandoned use of the micro-census databases available to academics. This micro-history uses a mix of demographic sources, cadastral records and maps available online during Covid times, as well as visits to remote archives after Lockdown. Access to private correspondence and newspapers during 1853 exposed personality clashes and anti-Russian sentiment, providing context and insight into the plans made by Prince Albert and Commander-in-Chief Hardinge to build a Camp on the heathland to the north of the village. Palmerston had charge of the Militia and there was clamour for investment in the military. The passing of an Enclosure Act caused upset, however, with division amongst the Commoners whose rights dated back to Anglo-Saxon times: two-thirds agreement was required in terms of rateable value. Spoiler Alert: Britain and France declared war in 1854, troops despatched to fight in the Crimea.

While archivists have a long history of practice guiding preservation decision-making and the deaccessioning or removal of records from archives, it is not clear how widely archival appraisal theory informs the approach to research data (Dorey, Hurley, and Knazook 2022). Long-term preservation of digital research data will prove challenging for repositories and preservationists, requiring substantially more information than is typically collected to support decisions about what to keep, how to maintain accessibility, and for how long. Preservationists need information about when the files were created, by whom, and using what software or tools, along with an understanding of the relevance of the data to the community of practice and its perceived long-term value. Curators play a critical role in communicating the informational value of datasets, and through their work with depositors, are in a unique position to collect information that will inform preservation decisions and reduce duplication of effort as data are (re)appraised over time, but they are often disconnected from preservation decision-making. In this panel discussion, we explore how training data curators in archival appraisal can help ensure long-term access to research data. We will hear an overview of a combined data curation and preservation workflow, and 3 institutions will discuss their experiences testing and refining a checklist developed at the Digital Research Alliance of Canada to record appraisal information about incoming datasets. We will end with a panel discussion and share a public version of the checklist.",

The Institutional RDM Strategy Review Group (composed of representatives from the Tri-Agencies, Digital Research Alliance of Canada’s Research Intelligence Expert Group, and University of Ottawa Researchers) has since collated all published institutional RDM strategies and conducted a quantitative description on institutions’ submission status and a qualitative analysis on characteristics of the strategies. This presentation will report on the preliminary findings of our study, focusing on the current RDM environment and initiatives at Canadian institutions that are reflected in their RDM strategies, such as the context of RDM strategy development, RDM governance, RDM related guidelines and policies, and RDM engagement strategies. Our presentation will speak to the readiness of Canadian research institutions to meet the agencies' RDM Policy’s incoming requirements for Data Management Plan (DMP) creation and data deposit. We will also report on how Canadian institutions recognize and discuss Indigenous data sovereignty, disciplinary RDM requirements, and EDI issues related to RDM. The results of our mapping provide an important step in the ongoing implementation of Canadian RDM activities and to ensure Canada’s continued leadership and innovation agenda. Our understanding of institutional strategies obtained from this work will serve to identify important organizational and infrastructural advancements, but also gaps in national policy, support services, and community infrastructure. We will highlight the previous efforts and future needs for a national level coordination and collaboration to foster RDM communities of practice and reduce duplication of effort.",

As a political science librarian supporting a department with an emphasis on computational methods, I have encountered a steady rise in questions from researchers looking to use a variety of textual data sources. These range from whether library books can be digitized for computational analysis, to whether our existing databases allow for automated searching and bulk downloading, to requests for new licensed resources for text mining. Additionally, recent changes to the social media data landscape, such as the monetization of the Twitter API, are shaking up researchers’ approaches for finding and accessing data, causing them to turn to the library for guidance. To better understand the specific needs and challenges of political science researchers using text mining methods, I conducted an analysis of recent dissertations from top political science programs. Specifically, I looked at what types of sources are used for text mining, how these sources are accessed, what challenges researchers encounter in working with large-scale textual data, and how libraries are involved in supporting this work. In this presentation I will highlight findings from this study, discuss how they have informed the way I and others at my institution are supporting text mining in the social sciences, and consider implications for libraries as we navigate the future of text as data.

Finding relevant data within a vast expanse of data can be quite challenging at times. Researchers have been working on finding different methods to offer the relevant data to users easily and swiftly. Focusing on data and its reusability, FAIR principles emphasize on the importance of findability of data. Finding the relevant data will make the life of data users easier and at the same time improves the reusability quotient of the data for data producer. For data archives, providing the relevant data to the data consumers is important. Data archives use keywords to define a study. These keywords are mostly chosen from the available set of controlled vocabularies (CVs) in the form of Thesauri. Sometimes the data producers, unable to find suitable keywords for their study use their own keywords, called user-defined keywords. User-defined keywords on one hand solves data producers’ problems, but on the other hand poses a challenge for the data archive to make data findable for future data consumers. One such example is GESIS Search. GESIS Search is a web-portal which provides a platform to find surveys and social science research data. Users can query the research data based on metadata fields like Topic, Author and many more. In this paper, we focus on Topic field to make the research data more findable. However, the user defined keywords in the Topic field acts as hinderance to data findability. Therefore, the role of assigning CVs to user-defined keywords is crucial to solve this challenge. Manually assigning CVs to user-defined keywords costs a majority of resources and time. We aim to employ Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques to automate the process of broader-term assignment from CVs, improving the findability along the way for the studies in GESIS Search.",

Approach one will make research easier by hosting all datasets in one place and creating one big data source. While this approach benefits from easy handling of data in one place, it also comes with issues like data ownership, data protection, and data documentation/services. Approach two is not demanding one single storage location. Data sets may be stored in different places, but they need to be structured to be “Linkage-Ready”. Being linkage-ready, or interoperable, demands, beside a useful identifier to link cases, a coordination of research domains, instruments, and universes. The talk will discuss the pros and cons of both approaches based on the current situation regarding the availability of data for research on education and learning in Switzerland.",

Finally, we will share our approach to and preliminary results from qualtitative research with stakeholder groups: researchers and their institutions, repositories, and scholarly societies. For each actor in the system, we seek to understand their plans, workflows, decision points, and concerns with respect to the evolving requirements. While this project takes a US focus, the findings are of broad potential interest as the practice of open science and research data sharing are referenced in the UNESCO Recommendation on Open Science, and subject to numerous national research funder policies around the world.",

The routines necessary for open access to research data will not only further “good data hygiene” among the research community, but also clarify in which situations data is in need of special protection. To achieve this degree of data management, certain levels of routines, standardization and infrastructure are required. In addition to this, a supporting culture and acceptance of the concept is required from researchers. We aim to create the physical, organizational and cultural conditions necessary to make more research data from SLU available according to the FAIR principles. A well-functioning process; from project planning, data acquisition, analysis and storage through to archiving and publication of research results, requires an equally well-functioning collaboration between the functions involved in data management support. It also requires clear routines as well as hard- and software that can connect the different parts of the process. In addition to all this, it depends on researchers and managers gaining an understanding of the value it may generate and a willingness to adapt routines to this. To achieve this a number of sub-projects have been initiated, all on the condition that a front desk – back office system is set up as the single point of entry, a function that can either answer or re-direct all data management related questions from researchers. The other sub-projects focus on i) building capacity, ii) development of routines and processes, iii) identifying and recruiting the required competencies, and iv) a communication and implementation plan.",

In the Canadian academic community, RDM is often supported by data specialists and librarians, and has developed an advanced service structure based on academic libraries and regional networks before a national RDM service was introduced. The range of support, which includes online tools, guides, training, consultations, research data repositories, and collegial networks, has grown dramatically over the past ten years. Canada is a large, geographically diverse and bilingual country with five distinct regions (Atlantic, Central, Prairie, West Coast, and North) where regional grass-roots support has grown into nationally coordinated services. The Digital Research Alliance of Canada (Alliance) has integrated RDM as an area of focus and is leading and coordinating the Canadian research community through the new era of infrastructure and service development. Looking ahead, the continuing contributions from research institutions, regional groups, and the Alliance will all be necessary to bring Canadian RDM support to a new level, along with more comprehensive consideration and inclusion of data management support to research on our Indigenous populations. The presentation will draw on the content of a chapter in a recent open-access book, \"Research Data Management in the Canadian Context: A Guide for Practitioners and Learners\", which focuses on the national and regional development of RDM in Canada. Authors from across Canada contributed to the open-access book, which is in use both in RDM training and Library and Information Science classes to educate and inform future and current data professionals. The book is released in both English and French, the official languages of Canada.",

The descriptions follow the DDI metadata standard and are harvested through OAI-PMH from the SPs. A central way of discovering data collections in the CDC is through the use of keywords. Many SPs use CESSDAs own thesaurus for the social sciences, European Language Social Science Thesaurus (ELSST), for keywords. ELSST aims to cover all relevant research subjects within the social science and consists of over 3,300 concepts available in 16 languages through an interactive webservice. In order to increase data discoverability, and fully utilize the structure of ELSST, we wanted to integrate CDC and ELSST. An important part was to maintain the user friendly UI of CDC, and at the same time support the complexities of ELSST. As a solution for this, the integration between the two services are done using API lookups of relevant metadata elements, presenting themselves as links for the user. Whenever a user discovers a data collection in CDC, there is a check to find out if a given keyword describing the data collection exists as a concept in ELSST. If this is the case, a link to the concept in ELSST is generated. The link will take the user to the concept in ELSST, where the user can read more about the concept and navigate through the thesaurus structure. From ELSST the user can directly search for data collections in the CDC marked with concepts the user discovers. The integration between the services is both simple and powerful. It enhances the functionality of both with regards to data discovery at the same time avoiding introduction of unnecessary complexities.",

As the region integrates digital technology into health systems and adopts artificial intelligence (AI), the need for collaborative data sharing becomes crucial. The African Union has established cybersecurity policies and data protection measures but progress to their implementation has been slow, with only a fraction of countries ratifying the Malabo Convention of 2014 as of March 2023. To contribute to these efforts, the African Population and Health Research Center (APHRC) organized a data governance policy dialogue in September 2023, in Naivasha, Kenya, involving diverse stakeholders to discuss the challenges and opportunities in the African data ecosystem. Methods: Participants were drawn from the national data protection office, ministry of health, national statistics bureau, population and health researchers, data producers, demographic surveillance systems, data managers and data scientists. Sessions included technical presentations, round table and panel discussions. Findings and Conclusions: We found that key gaps to data sharing in African included lack of standardized data management and sharing principles, administrative and bureaucratic barriers, mistrust resulting from fear of data misrepresentation, misuse and breach of privacy, and data systems that are not interoperable. To navigate this, the academia has a crucial role to play. First, in strengthening capacity and creating awareness about data privacy and protection, and second, in contributing to research on best practices. This includes working with research community to develop training curricula on data governance and sharing. Further, there was emphasis on development of comprehensive data governance frameworks at institutional, national and regional levels. The data governance framework should be tailored to the unique challenges and opportunities in Africa, and leverage the power of AI in its implementation and research.",

It explores the development challenges and the diverse technologies employed, contextualised within the broader scope of data services. The new tools were in the final stages of development at the time of writing. We opted to construct these tools from the ground up, a decision influenced by the complex nature of the underlying data, which necessitated high levels of flexibility and adaptability. This paper will critically evaluate the decision-making process, weighing the advantages and disadvantages of developing in-house solutions versus the trend of relying on external, often commercial, platforms. Third-party solutions frequently compromise functionality and the ability to tailor to specific requirements, especially when dealing with highly complex data. The presentation will showcase some functionalities of these new tools, highlighting ongoing enhancements, including integrating AI and machine-learning technologies. We will also discuss the advantages of the design principle to separate the user interface from the backend API. This approach improves user experience and promotes better interoperability. While acknowledging that budget and overall resource constraints are a common hurdle in such initiatives, this case study provides insights into the feasible options available to data services striving to deliver robust and comprehensive data to their users. The insights and experience shared are intended to contribute to the dynamic relationship between data services and information science, especially when dealing with data related to the social sciences. By offering practical examples and lessons learned, we aim to inform those enhancing data accessibility, utility, and distribution in a rapidly evolving digital environment, where data services often face challenges in keeping pace with technological advances.",

Data reuse has become central to an emerging cultural push towards a more open way of doing science. This study investigated the challenges and opportunities in reusing research data among digital humanities (DH) scholars. Its findings may serve as a case study for how disciplinary practices influence the ways in which researchers reuse data. The aim of the study was to enhance current thinking and provide insight for data, information and library professionals who work at the intersection of the humanities and data. Data were collected using interviews. An analysis of semi-structured interviews with 12 DH scholars working at universities, research centres and cultural or heritage organizations around the world was performed, and found that lack of time and resources, inconsistent data practices, technical training gaps, labour intensity and difficulties in finding data were the most challenging aspects of data reuse. Findings also revealed a number of enabling factors in data reuse chiefly collaboration and autonomous learning as a feature of DH. The results indicate a gap between data reusers and data sharers - low rates of sharing reduce the amount of findable and accessible data available for reuse. Both data reusers and data sharers must begin to see themselves as embedded into the research data lifecycle within the research infrastructure. The recommendations includes cultural changes to policy, education, and infrastructure. Other interventions could include boosting data literacy, developing self-paced RDM training, improving data discovery systems, rewarding data sharing, and creation of data stewardship networks.",

Canadian academic institutions that are eligible to administer federal research funding were also required to create an institutional research data management strategy this past year (as described in the Tri-Agency RDM policy). As a result, academic institutions need to develop strategic, coordinated approaches to providing research data services, in order to avoid siloed and inefficient duplication of services across campus and potential gaps in programming and support. This presentation will compare and contrast the efforts of two Canadian university libraries who are participating in the Ithaka S+R initiative “Building Campus Strategies for Coordinated Data Support,” a cohort-based project with 29 universities across Canada and the US. Based on analyses of research data services currently offered and the experiences of researchers in navigating and accessing existing services, the presenters will explore various topics, including the types of services currently offered at these two institutions, the roles various service providers play (e.g., library, research office, IT), and the areas identified as opportunities for future investment. Other topics will include potential mechanisms of coordinating and collaborating to develop and offer effective research data services and the various opportunities for leveraging regional or national services and infrastructure. Given the relevance of research data services and research data management for institutions broadly, the questions and issues discussed will be of interest to IASSIST attendees regardless of geographic location.",

How Business Librarians' Data Skills Support the Future of Library Data Services",          "abstract": "As we plot the future of data services in libraries, the interdisciplinary nature of data services means that increasing collaboration between functional data librarians and subject liaison librarians is a key trend. As well, subject liaison librarians are learning new skills and recognizing existing literacies to better serve their user populations. An example of this is data skils inherent to business librarianship. Business librarians are pragmatic data librarians, often not recognizing the extent of their data skills and abilities to provide data services. Especially in workplaces without specialist or standalone data librarians, business and economics librarians often function also as the de facto data librarian, handling data reference questions without additional support. The diverse, complex nature of business information means that business librarians have a significant ability to support patrons as they navigate siloed data, search for free data sources, and build datasets when no existing source is readily available. This presentation will focus on how business librarians’ data skills complement services provided by functional data librarians, and how business librarians already have many of the skills to meet patrons’ data needs in the absence of specialist support. From their experiences as business librarians and examples from the literature, the presenters will lay out basic strengths and challenges data librarians or service coordinators can anticipate from building partnerships with business librarians. In particular, the session will present the value business librarians can bring to data sourcing, data synthesis, and incorporating data alongside other information sources. Presenters will also identify intervention points where data experts can support business librarians, in areas such as data visualization, alternative data sourcing, and systematic approaches to data literacy.",

The signature activity of IPUMS is harmonizing variable codes and documentation to be fully consistent across datasets. Major data types include U.S. and international censuses, global health data, major U.S. demographic surveys, labor force surveys, and educational surveys. In addition to census and survey microdata, IPUMS integrates and disseminates area-level census data and electronic boundaries describing census geography for the U.S. and internationally. While the activities of harmonizing data and documentation are similar across IPUMS projects, their processes are organized around the partners, data sources, unique content issues, and timelines of each project. The IPUMS Archive is instituting a workflow mapping strategy to further identify IPUMS process and metadata capture points for the data archive. Drawing on two business process models, the Generic Statistical Business Process Model (GSBPM) and the Generic Longitudinal Business Process Model (GLBPM), archival staff customized the GSBPM and the GLBPM to create an IPUMS Business Process Model (IPUMS BPM). The IPUMS BPM reflects the use of secondary data sources and the work of harmonization and integration to create a data infrastructure that supports research across time and space. Internally, the IPUMS BPM provides a clear visualization of our workflow from external submission of data, harmonization process, extraction systems, and archival preservation of metadata. The challenge for archival staff is furthering the understanding and adoption of the IPUMS BPM within the IPUMS project groups, and to identify metadata production points that requires the intervention of the archive for provenance and preservation purposes. This presentation identifies the value of this mapping approach in gaining a clearer understanding of the role of the archive within project work cycles and points where activities intersect.",

When IASSIST began, and for many years afterwards, there was expectation that research libraries kept all kinds of that important printed stuff safe on their shelves, not only scholarly journals but other periodicals such as newspapers, trade magazines and government publications.  The early IASSISTers struggled to have datasets regarded as first class objects within academic support services. That battle might be won, but now our research libraries no longer keep the digital equivalent of that other important stuff. Instead they depend upon third parties as keepers of content for scholarly communication journals.  The Keepers Registry, hosted at https:\/\/keepers.issn.org, has become the global monitor on what is being kept by the likes of CLOCKSS, Portico, PKP-PLN, as well as some national libraries and university consortia. The Internet Archive has also signed up as a Keeper.  ISSN is now applied to the websites of governments, news media, commerce, trade and professional bodies and a myriad of other platforms reckoned to have lasting significance. Recent analysis of data from the ISSN Portal indicated progress but also shines a light upon what is reckoned to be at most risk of loss. Not only ‘The Long Tail’ of small publishers, with alarm bells for Open Access journals, but even more so for the wider set of published heritage which is issued online.  Social media diverts our attention; let's not neglect the web resources more formally published online as digital content as they are critical for our scholarship and for public understanding, now and into the future.",

By examining the obstacles to the introduction of self-deposit services stricto sensu (with minimum involvement of the data stewards), which are still rare, we will look closely at how data stewards support the curation and documentation effort that must be handled, at least partially, by the depositors themselves. Our analysis shows that self-deposit practices are a trend that is particularly marked in emerging archives. Very few studies tackled this subject head-on: how are curation practices actually carried out? What are the various costs involved? What types of guidelines are provided to depositors? How are the archive's recommendations and instructions accepted and followed by depositors? To what extent is the data re-use potential taken into account when it comes to self-deposit? While some of these questions have been addressed in the literature, albeit in very general terms, there is very little concrete feedback out there. This is the subject our paper tackles. Empirically, our research is based on 20 interviews (an in-depth questionnaire and/or guided interviews conducted remotely) conducted, between 2021 and 2022, with CESSDA archives or repositories referenced by the Dataverse network. In this paper, we will discuss several pitfalls in the implementation of open science policies: the difficulties in finding the right balance between the archive's workflows and the flexibility granted to depositors; the gap between the limited resources that data curation teams have and the extent of the tasks that ultimately fall on them to make data FAIR; the uncertainties over the modes of reasoned division of labour that can be put in place between depositors, data stewards and other data professionals, to optimise the self deposit workflow and the articulation deficit between self-deposit practices and the data re-use potential.",

Feminist and left groups had been campaigning for a liberalisation of abortion laws in Ireland from the 1980s onwards. In this presentation we will give an overview of the Archiving Reproductive Health project which provides long-term preservation and access to the many at-risk archives generated by grassroots women’s reproductive health movements during the campaign. The project was funded by the Wellcome Trust and co-ordinated by the Digital Repository of Ireland (DRI). DRI is a trusted digital repository, which provides reliable long-term preservation and access to Ireland’s humanities, cultural heritage, and social sciences digital data. The collections preserved include: the records of the stakeholder organisations in the Repeal of the Eighth campaigns, the In Her Shoes: Women of the Eighth Facebook page, the first Facebook dataset to be archived in the Digital Repository of Ireland and research data generated by social science researchers examining the campaign. Not only does the project archive material from the recent repeal campaign (2012 - 2018), but it also archives historical campaigns on reproductive health including interviews with activists who were involved in the women’s movement in the 1970s, 1980s, 1990s and early 2000s. This paper will give an overview of the collections. We will also outline both how the project benefited from the advice and guidance of key stakeholders as well as our less successful attempts to ensure that stakeholders’ were centred in the archiving process.",

By merging geospatial analysis of land use with sentiment analysis from social media, this study explores the profound influence of urban landscapes on both crime occurrences and societal perceptions. The analysis begins with a comprehensive set of urban data to delineate crime hotspots and uncover correlations with the urban form, shedding light on the 'when' and 'where' of crime incidents. Complementary to this is the sentiment analysis of social media content, which taps into the community's pulse on crime and safety, offering a deeper understanding of the 'how' and 'why' behind public reactions—dimensions often underrepresented in traditional crime analysis. Despite limitations in geotagged data, innovative natural language processing techniques, aim to approximate spatial sentiment distributions. This bifocal approach not only pinpoints areas of concern but also clarifies the public's response to crime, which could steer policy and urban planning towards impactful interventions. The integration of diverse data types is essential for a holistic view, one that balances quantitative crime data with the qualitative nuances of human experience. The presentation undertakes a deep dive into how data-driven insights can empower data and geospatial professionals within research, libraries and archives to craft narratives that blend numbers with nuance, aiding in the design of safer, more resilient urban space.",

Settlement occurred in 'blocks' – farm-sized quarter sections demarcated by the Dominion Lands Survey. Block settlement allowed the new migrants to settle among family and communities and contributed to the growth of a strong Ukrainian Canadian community. This was initially preferred by immigration and land agents, as it made their work easier, but the practice soon fell out of favour. Despite government opposition, Ukrainians continued to settle in these same patterns, establishing the Ukrainian Canadians as one of main ethnic groups that contributed to the development of the newly established Western Canada and Dominion of Canada. This project will use census data along with archival and genealogical documents to create an interactive map showing the movement of Ukrainians to and across Canada throughout their 130-year period of immigration. Most of the demographic information about the history of Ukrainian block settlement is contained in static thematic maps that were published over 30 years ago. With the addition of census data, these maps can be transformed into dynamic and interactive objects. This project seeks to preserve the historically significant research on Ukrainian immigrant block settlements with the creation of an openly accessible geospatial resource that includes historic and contemporary census data. This interactive mapping project will be a valuable resource for researchers, educators, and the general public interested in exploring the multifaceted narrative of Ukrainian immigration in Canada.",

One of these barriers is a lack of accessibility. Standard guidelines for the design and construction of accessible environments have been implemented since the 1960s, but they do not cover the built environment that already exists. Consequently, when traveling to an unfamiliar place, people with disabilities (and others) cannot expect the spaces to be accessible to them. In lieu of the total removal of barriers, which may never be achieved, some information tools may help with feelings of independence and some researchers claim that access to information about the environment is even more important than removing physical barriers. There are existing sources of information about accessibility, however, they often lack clear criteria to describe accessibility, especially for different types of disabilities or ranges of ability and preference within disability groups. Additionally, each person with a disability has unique interactions with the built environment that impact accessibility including both barriers and facilitators to mobility. This talk will discuss the importance of collecting information about accessibility and share a set of criteria for collecting data related to the accessibility of public places like restaurants, doctors offices, government offices, etc. The hope is that this criteria can be used both locally by local enthusiasts and globally international technology companies to collect and share data about the accessibility of everyday places so people traveling to those locations can make more informed decisions about that location’s accessibility.",

Recently, there has been significant buzz around text analysis and generative artificial intelligence, emphasizing their potential impact on human society.  In our panel session, we will introduce the concept of text analysis and its importance. Librarians from four diverse higher education institutions, ranging from a large STEM focussed institution to a small liberal arts university, will discuss meeting the many text analysis needs arising on their campuses: integrating text analysis pedagogy across campus, running workshops out of the library, working with faculty to integrate it into class materials, and supporting research on campus. The panelists will also speak to some of the challenges inherent in supporting this work, ranging from budgetary concerns to issues of data management, access, and reproducibility.  With students and faculty from all disciplines adopting text analysis, academic libraries have the opportunity to become primary supporters of this approach.",

The SVTP project aims to reduce these difficulties by the construction of an answering machine. The machine will learn to answer from previous experiences, from surveys already conducted on subjects of interest (tourism in our case). The project we will work on a panel of tourism surveys to create a virtual survey campaign by means of the automated answering machine. The proposed machine will be able to answer survey questions. We have already done 10 surveys in years 20,21,22,23 about tourism in Piedmont for the local administration. Three for Sommers, three for Autumns, three for Winter and one for testing purpose (Autumn 23). We have already built a base line automated survey from the previous nine surveys and compared the answers of this survey on the test survey (Autumn 23) which results will be presented. Furthermore, several simulation trials using different forecasting techniques will be done: logistic regression and decisional trees for example. The models test will compare the model results with the baseline model to better preview the number of future Piedmont tourist visitors. The results of the test will be presented. Something like what ChatGPT does building artificial questionnaires, just to give an example. We will generate the answers instead. Philosophic implications of all of this are obvious.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics sits alone outside this basic framework. These DOL agencies produce data, but this activity is not the main focus of their work. This has consequences, as discoverability, quality, understanding, interoperability, and the ability to blend data are not optimized. The Office of Data Governance (ODG) at DOL was established and resolved to address these issues. The task for the office is to develop a framework for good data governance at DOL and set a path towards building the capabilities to maintain it. All this is to be done with a small staff and very little budget. The focus of this talk will be on the 5 enforcement agencies at DOL: EBSA (benefits), MSHA (mine safety), OFCCP (federal contracts), OSHA (occupational safety), and WHD (wages). Enforcement is somewhat of a misnomer, as the main interest of the agencies is to gain compliance with their laws and regulations. When an inspection occurs and violations are found, the efforts of the agencies are to bring the violating establishments into compliance. The efforts are not to punish, though fines are sometimes necessary. With the exception of mining, inspections occur when a violation is suspected at some establishment. So, the data are not representative of a larger population, and the data are mostly hand entered. As would be expected, problems arise from this situation. In the talk, we will describe the program being developed by ODG with emphasis on • working with the other agencies • functionality being developed • problems being solved stressing the adaptation of parts of DDI-CDI and the use of machine actionable metadata.",

The need is to consider the experience of advanced developed countries in creating a full-fledged NPR. Therefore, the paper will focus on the development of NPR. In order to fulfill the objectives, baseline data was obtained from the Bangladesh Bureau of Statistics (BBS) in collaboration with the National Household Database (NHD) project under the Ministry of Planning. In NHD, all the households were recorded in a census-like fashion. A total of 14 basic types of data are available for creating NPR. The primary element of the system is the Personal Identification Number (PIN). This unique identifier has been the core element of the NPR. Another element in the system is the Family tree. NHD also covered family relationships and dwellings, allowing data on individuals to be linked by family and household head. Some 10 or 11-digit PIN numbers will be generated by the NPR authority with considered as standard practice. The PIN number for a child will be generated when thire parents register the child’s birth. The local ‘Birth & Death Registration’ office will be responsible for NPR data updating. The secondary element in the system is “One Person One File” (OPOF). Each personal file in the NPR will hold the history of changes in terms of the registered date and the action that triggered the change of personal data in the register. Once the OPOF objective is ensured, the second objective, “register once-multiple use”, becomes important. The other objective ensures data quality and the reproducibility of NPR data. The novelty of the paper lies in a generalized and comparative analysis of the population register of Bangladesh. ",

By defining a set of properties that indicates good practice for making data findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable (FAIR), a quality measurement is created, which can be applied to many research outputs, including research data. There are some software tools available to help with the assessment, with the F-UJI tool being the most prominent of them. It uses a set of metrics which defines tests for each of the FAIR components, and it creates an overall assessment score. The FAIR assessment is done by using aggregated metadata for a research dataset, e.g. from the data webpage URL, from a PID provider like DataCite and others, and more services like repository information by re3data. The presentation will examine differences between manually and automatically assessing FAIR principles, show the different results, and use Election Studies and COVID data studies as examples. It will highlight the role of archives in securing a high level of data and metadata quality and technically sound implementation of the FAIR principles to help researchers benefit from getting the most of their valuable research data.",

It currently follows a self-deposit model that allows U of T researchers to deposit and publish their data without intervention unless requested. Considering increased usage of the repository and new and developing data deposit policies, we conducted an assessment of U of T Dataverse to (1) review the quality of published datasets, and (2) understand who is using the repository. This was accomplished by analyzing the monthly Borealis metrics and conducting a quality assessment of select datasets’ structure and associated metadata. Ultimately, this assessment will be used to help conceptualize curation services and identify resources to develop that would enable high-quality data deposits. In this presentation we will discuss our approach to this assessment, preliminary findings, and how this project will shape our approach to service and resource development. Overall, this project will allow us to better understand disciplinary trends relating to who is (and isn’t) using U of T Dataverse, help develop clear processes and guidelines, and inform training and departmental outreach. Longer-term, it will help us estimate the effort and time required to provide curation services, inform priorities for repository development, and help us anticipate the impact any change in national policy may have in demand for institutional services.",

Creating a FAIR Self-Assessment Checklist for Data Repositories",          "abstract": "In 2022, a team from a local grant-funded medical data repository team contacted the University of Pennsylvania Libraries’ Research Data & Digital Scholarship unit asking for guidance on evaluating the extent that their repository was FAIR enabling. After a consultation with the repository team, our research data experts discovered that many of the current self-assessments of the FAIR guidelines were for data creators rather than data repository managers. In addition, we wanted a self-assessment tool similar to the process and guidance created by CoreTrustSeal but with a focus explicitly on FAIR principles. In answer to their request, the Penn Libraries’ Research Data Engineer conducted a literature review and coalesced current guidance and assessment tools on the principles. After this review of the existing documentation, a small team consisting of the Research Data Engineer, the Head of Research Data Services, the Director of Data and Innovation Services, and the Bioinformatics Librarian developed through an iterative process a self-assessment tool for repository managers regarding FAIR principles. In addition to several iterations of the tool, we also met with the repository managers for feedback on ways to make the tool more understandable. Our discussions provided insights into the challenges of explaining the FAIR principles to those without information science backgrounds. The discussions we had and the development of this self-assessment tool helped to develop a more transparent and trustworthy repository. This paper will discuss the development of the assessment, the goals for utilizing the tool, and lessons learned. Reporting our findings as they currently stand will prompt the research data management field to ruminate on FAIR principle adoption for data repositories. We also intend for this paper to encourage more conversation on the usability of the FAIR principles for professionals without an information science background.",

Lunaris’ bilingual platform is a single point of search facilitating discovery of Canadian research data held in any of a growing number of data sources, including institutional repositories and government open data sources, among others. Lunaris’ index of Canadian research data is also harvested by other discovery services. Lunaris allows geospatial search of datasets that contain some geospatial information by providing a map-based search interface that limits returned datasets to those within a user-specified bounding box. Lunaris integrates this map-based geospatial search with traditional keyword-based search and filtering, allowing users to directly search for data in a given topic area that is related to a geographical region of interest. As part of ongoing discovery work, the Access-Limited Data Discovery Working Group, part of the Network of Experts, identified 137 data sources that contain datasets that are not immediately accessible or for which access or discovery is limited (https:\/\/doi.org\/10.31219\/osf.io\/pa5fx). The group assessed how well those data sources met a set of discoverability and access criteria, and found areas for improvement that the discovery, access, and metadata community might use as an opportunity for growth. This presentation will demonstrate Lunaris’ search capabilities, outline the Access-Limited Data Discovery Working Group’s effort to assess the discoverability of access-limited data, and present plans to work with sources of access-limited data to make that data discoverable with Lunaris. Attendees will learn how they can use Lunaris to discover Canadian data that is relevant to their research interests, learn how Lunaris may facilitate data reuse by enhancing data discoverability, and be introduced to the ongoing efforts to integrate data sources with limited discoverability into a leading national data discovery service in Canada.",

In 1968, H. S. Bostock published “A Catalogue of Selected Airphotographs”, a catalogue of selected air photos of geomorphologic phenomena in Canada, for the Geological Survey of Canada. This catalogue included over 800 air photos, both verticals and obliques, from the National Air Photo Library (NAPL). The photos were selected to highlight various subjects or phenomena found in Canada, with an emphasis placed on glaciological and glacial features. Examples of classifications of features included: landslides, waterfalls, canyons, deltas, estuaries, folded strata, highland glacier systems, shelf ice, glacier dammed lakes, volcanoes, meteorite craters, and many more. These photos covered much of northern Canada and originated from hundreds of flightlines generally taken between the 1940s and ‘60s. The uOttawa Library has had this collection in its holdings in paper format for decades but was the subject of a digitization project in fall 2023 and published to the uOttawa Library’s Digital Asset Management System (DAMS) for improved accessibility, preservation, and distribution. The associated catalogue from Bostock provided additional metadata for the photos, such as the general region, subject classification, and a description of the features in each image. With this digital collection, users can now search for model photos matching a variety of geomorphological features by keyword to support research and learning.",

While the traditional LC curriculum introduces tidy data concepts and tools such as Git, the Unix shell, and OpenRefine, early work using the new lesson adoption model has begun to integrate lessons on artificial intelligence, computational thinking, and data curation. LC-CAC has also partnered with UCLA to support the inclusion of materials developed under the IMLS-funded Lessons for Librarians in Open Science project (https:\/\/ucla-imls-open-sci.info). Six new lessons focused on topics such as data management, open qualitative research, open science hardware, and reproducible workflows are already being developed during year one of the two-year grant.",

The purpose of this paper is to explore how online training events can support social science students to develop data skills. We present results from a qualitative research project using in-depth interviews with social science students who have participated in UK Data Service (UKDS) online training events. We use reflective thematic analysis (Braun & Clarke 2021) to explore how the training enhances their data literacy and helps them acquire skills that they can use in their studies and research careers. We also discuss how the results from the project are feeding back into developments in the UKDS data skills training programme.",

I was accepted and paired with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. The CIO of their library wanted to know which entity was doing what and what activities were duplicated, essentially an environmental scan. The survey provides a sharable information product for other libraries to use to assess and evaluate their own RDM and Data Science and Analytical activities. The objective of this environmental scan was to document and evaluate the data services provided across RPI by asking the following questions: 1. What department is providing what RDM and Data Science and Analytics service? 2. What are the wholes or duplication of effort across the institution? And 3. What roles are LIS professionals playing in the RDM and Data Science and Analytics arena, broadly and locally? Methods: Used a systematic review of data services to design the survey and specifically included services across engineering disciplines. Upon completion of the survey including input from my capstone partner, I plan to use the survey to review RPI’s website methodically and thoroughly. This survey will increase the richness and rigor of the final report to RPI as well as identify the roles LIS professionals are playing in the RDM and Data Science and Analytics across the institution. Because this is a content analysis of websites, IRB approval was not sought. The study is currently ongoing. Results will be shared at the conference. Conclusions from findings will be shared at the conference.",

Data descriptions are seen as a vehicle that can help to increase transparency and create awareness of potential shortcomings and ethical issues for predictive modeling. Among the most prominent is perhaps the proposal of \"Datasheets for Datasets\" by Gebru et al (2021). Data sheets provide information about provenance, use, and limitations and ask questions about the social and ethical implications of data production and use. The use of these templates is voluntary, suggestive, and modular. So how are they actually applied? Based on the analysis of about 62,000 data sets from Hugging Face, as well as a close reading of selected case studies this project attempts to gain insight into the practices of using Data Sheets for Machine Learning training data.

Methods in metadata discovery and documentation using Generative AI",          "abstract": "Since its launch in November 2022, ChatGPT has become a focal point for data analytics and discovery with many researchers, students, policy-makers and layman all turning to Generative AI to assist with documentation and interpretation of data. In this new world, the question arises - why do we need metadata if AI can fill in the gaps in our own understanding. While data and metadata practitioners understand that the context and nuance of data understanding are dependent on timely, high quality documentation there remains a bridge between best practice and real-world scenarios. To bridge this gap, data librarians and data governance areas must be able to communicate to stakeholders the value of good metadata, while also integrating new technologies. Given the reliance on emerging cloud or software-as-a-service technologies, there must also be a focus on educating users on how to preserve data privacy when using Generative AI tools to minimise data leakage. In this presentation, we look at how Generative AI tools such as ChatGPT and data analytics tools like Pandas can be used to augment data documentation and reduce the burden on data custodians without reducing data quality by exploring the following topics: * Methods in developing and running local language models * Retraining language models using metadata resources * Matching, summarising and generating data to generate metadata * Privacy-perserving methods in publishing auto-generated content. This is done using Aristotle Activate, an open-source database scanning and metadata linkage tool designed to interact with the Aristotle Metadata Registry to retrain and refine language models, as well upload and publish linked and generated metadata.",

We address these issues by proposing an urban dataset meta-data maturity model and framework that enhances meta-data management vital for data librarians and curators. We aim to establish a meta-data standard that simplifies finding datasets, catering to various stakeholders—governmental, commercial, civil, and philanthropic—and supporting global data sharing among urban data managers and repositories. Methodology: Leveraging existing meta-data standards like DCAT, Schema.org, DQV, and the FAIR principles, the proposed standard introduces a dataset meta-data maturity model categorized into seven distinct categories. Following Fox et al. (2024), the model provides a framework for defining and representing the maturity of a dataset’s meta-data, where higher maturity denotes greater detail, focusing on attributes that facilitate searching by topic, spatial and temporal aspects of datasets. Other levels focus on licensing, governance, adherence to FAIR principles, privacy and quality issues. The model integrates linked-data standards and enhances meta-data analysis by transforming meta-data into a knowledge graph. We evaluate the model by statistical analysis of entries in a catalogue of urban datasets. The model comprises six levels of meta-data attributes: Level 1: Basic information often used in dataset searches, including descriptions and temporal/geospatial data, for easy retrieval and identification. Level 2: Dataset access information, including location, licensing, and points of contact. Level 3: Additional documentation and access meta-data, alignment with FAIR principles for improved identification and interoperability. Level 4: Privacy matters, including individualized (vs aggregate) data and Indigenous data collection standards. Level 5: FAIR principles, ensuring findability, accessibility, interoperability, and retrievability. Level 6: Statistical and quality meta-data, focusing on completeness and accuracy. - Fox, M., Gajderowicz ,B., Lyu, D. (2024), A Maturity Model for Urban Dataset Meta-data.

Some example citation metrics will be presented for GIS datasets found in MI and the BTAA Geoportal, and the portal will be briefly introduced. The BTAA Geoportal (run by the Big Ten Academic Alliance Geospatial Information Network) is hoping to expand into holding some government datasets for longitudinal availability and preservation, as most government agencies replace older datasets with new ones and then remove the older datasets from places of public access. It is hoped that by letting government agencies understand where and how people are using their data through citations may encourage them to allow the BTAA Geoportal Project to do this. Government agencies are often reluctant to or hold ambivalence about offering GIS datasets to the public, and they may be especially reluctant to allow researchers to access the underlying data for public presented web maps. Helping government data creators understand the broader impacts of their offerings could encourage more sharing of data in ways that are accessible for researchers and metrics might also be useful to justify funding for data provision to elected officials.",

While access to data and services is key to enabling global system research, it is not sufficient to simply build a system and expect successful uptake: domain-based examples of data use are required to demonstrate techniques and methods to integrate local data, Earthdata GIS services, and other cloud-based data in data analysis workflows.

Based on seven indicators (the OGD portal, engagement with the public, data quality, metadata, data utilization, organization data privacy, and data interoperability) the New-Policies around OGD will be focusing on. Therefore, this paper presents a conceptual analysis of OGD and characterizes conditions under which the intended open data policy’s S.M.A.R.T goals can be achieved. It is a way forward for more systematic data sharing for the whole of government in the future. The paper also emphasizes that the National Statistical Office (NSO) remains the government institution responsible for aggregating official data, information and protecting the data of its citizens. Our findings suggest that smart government (e-gov to we-gov) in practice depends on the ways that social, organizational, and institutional strategies cope with technological change and become a bridge to creativity in developing a new ecosystem in the Fifth Industrial Revolution (5IR) and the digital data-driven smart society.",

Despite this, credit-based university courses are rarely taught by librarians. Part of this is practical: librarians are often full-time practitioners and academic instruction isn’t in their job descriptions. But teaching a credit course provides distinct advantages over more common one-shot instruction: Instructors have the flexibility to create cohesive whole curriculums; to delve deeply into data topics, to upskill and reignite interest in data topics, to connect with researchers and students in new ways and new contexts, to explore a world of freely available open access learning materials shared by the international RDM community. This session relates the experiences of librarians teaching credit bearing data literacy courses at two Canadian universities. They will discuss how they mapped data literacies to the course, choice of platforms, and how their professional practice has information their teaching and vice versa. All instructors used open source, community developed resources and drew from their real-life experience to create engaging learning experiences to help their students learn and get excited about data!

Despite the widespread use of the same standards and platforms, too few examples exist of academic libraries navigating beyond silos to shared infrastructure and services. As the scope of academic libraries grows to support research data as part of the scholarly resources that we steward, is it possible to develop shared research data management (RDM) services and infrastructures collaboratively? Six years have passed since a recommendation was made by [country’s] national research library association to establish a national data repository that would provide a robust, scalable, and affordable shared service. Building a national repository together would harness available but limited and distributed expertise in RDM, and encourage the collective creation and reuse of materials supporting training, user support, and outreach. Since 2019, [Data Repository] began formally offering the service nationally, governed in partnership with regional academic library consortia, which now supports over 70 [Country] institutions, each managing a locally-branded collection and providing local support to researchers. Has this push for greater equity been realized by [Data Repository] and what are the experiences of its institutional administrators? This presentation reports the results of a community-led survey of [Country] [Data Repository]’s administrators, focusing on their individual perspectives on challenges, barriers, and needs of the emerging community. Overall, the results of the survey highlight a unique effort to build equitable data sharing infrastructure that is national in scope and reflective of community needs. Understanding both the infrastructure demands and the needs for support from our community provides insights on how to plan future programs and software development initiatives. Learning from our experiences and our community can benefit other national and international large-scale repository initiatives in charting the future of data.",

Due to the sensitivity and comprehensiveness of the data, the integration of (AI-based) technology in data curation, data sharing and data analysis workflows needs to be carefully addressed, as well as issues of interdisciplinary approaches. Furthermore, researchers from different disciplines will be interested in using qualitative data, and vice versa, qualitative researchers will be interested in using data from other methodological backgrounds that lend themselves to the application of qualitative analysis. In the face of these developments and challenges, collaboration between data infrastructures with expertise in the curation and provision of qualitative data is key. Networks such as QualidataNet, a community-centered federated network of RDCs, seek to share and discuss common solutions for harmonization and standardization where possible. Its focus is to provide a single point of access to qualitative datasets from different data providers and to promote the sharing and reuse of qualitative data in line with the FAIR Data Principles. QualidataNet is part of the Consortium for Social, Behavioral, Educational and Economic Sciences (KonsortSWD) at the National Research Data Infrastructure (NFDI) in Germany. It coordinates the international cooperation within the DDI via the DDI-CDI Subgroup \"Non-Numeric, Non-Code Datums\", which aims at a standardized and comprehensive metadata description of data objects to enable cross domain integration. We will present the current work, future steps and plans of this international effort: In addition, we would like to continue exploring opportunities for international collaboration and exchange, and invite for participation with the goal of shaping FAIR's ways of processing, archiving, and reusing qualitative data objects.",

Adaptive governance was originally conceptualized in the late 1900s as a strategy for resource land management and is defined as \"the evolution of the rules and norms that promote the satisfaction of underlying human needs and preferences given changes in understanding, objectives, and the social, economic and environmental context\" by Hatfield-Dodds, Nelson, and Cook in their paper \"Adaptive Governance: An Introduction and Implications for Public Policy. Australian Agricultural and Resource Economics Society\", 2007. This concept was later adopted by data governance groups to ensure that rules and policies were adhered to while providing enough flexibility to meet the various data needs and nuances that exist across the data management landscape. In the context of research data management, adaptive governance can be applied by ensuring researchers meet university policies, funder and publisher requirements while providing flexibility to respond to researcher differences and concerns, such as data types and sharing restrictions. This presentation will cover the history and definition of adaptive governance as well as tips and examples for applying this concept to data management activities at each stage of the research data lifecycle. Included are data management planning, file naming and organization, data documentation, storage location and repository selection, and preservation considerations.",

CLOSER and NACDA have implemented different metadata organization within their respective portals, CLOSER Discovery (discovery.closer.ac.uk) and NACDA Colectica portal (harmonize.icpsr.umich.edu). As two independent organizations, we intend to share information and in the future create an age-specific portal to allow comparisons across international borders, making it easier for researchers to find relevant data quickly, while supporting data harmonization, accessibility, interoperability, and reuse. Since the researcher journey broadly begins at a high level, then drills down to find the most appropriate variables, we propose to create a proof of concept at a conceptual group level. The use of metadata standards and collaboration are essential for providing researchers with these infrastructures. Since both CLOSER Discovery and NACDA portals operate with metadata documented using the DDI metadata standard, we can leverage this in an interoperable way, without recreating efforts. The presentation will set out how we have built a collaboration and will outline the likely approach to cross-country discoverability and best practice.",

The ONS Longitudinal Study, follows a 1% sample of the England & Wales population from the decennial census data (1971 – 2011), linked to births, deaths and cancer registration data. Sample members are selected on the basis of four confidential birthdays, with new study members entering the study through birth on one of the four birthdays or immigration (and being born on one of the four birthdays), and leave through death or emigration. The main strength of the ONS-LS is its large sample size (>1 million), making it the largest nationally representative dataset in the UK, and allowing the analysis of small areas and specific population groups. The ONS-LS currently has 46 years of follow-up data 1971 – 2017, and the upcoming linkage of the 2021 Census data to the Study will extend this follow-up to 2021 enabling researchers to examine changes that have taken place in the 2011 – 2021 period, which saw Brexit and the Covid 19 pandemic. The paper will introduce the data available in the ONS-LS and will discuss its size and scope. The support available to researchers interested in using the ONS-LS in their research is also highlighted, as are the arrangements for accessing the data. The presentation summarises some recent examples of research using the ONS-LS and highlights some key areas for future research. It concludes with a brief introduction to the ONS-LS’s sister studies, the Scottish Longitudinal Study and the Northern Ireland Longitudinal Study, and the opportunities that these studies offer for comparative research.",

This is called the Northern Ireland Official Publications Archive, (NIOPA). Collection development guidelines and metadata capture are agreed with the British Library under contract to preserve digital works under the Legal Deposit Libraries (Non-Print Works) Regulations 2013. Digital assets are harvested from departmental, agency, Northern Ireland Assembly and other official websites and added to the Archive for long-term preservation using DSpace open-source software. Discoverability is enhanced by agreed metadata standards that are transformed from dc to MARC format and cascaded to multiple legal deposit libraries. The records are also discoverable via OCLC. Essential to the working of this Archive are fortress-like relationships with a range of partner organisations (British Library and associated Legal Deposit libraries), and stakeholders (156 official governmental bodies and universities). The relationships are foundational, predicated upon necessary and legal obligation, fundamental to the future-proofing the Archive and resulting in synchronous activities and procedures. This has created an impressive cross-institutional and multi-agency model of collaboration which has been the gateway for subsequent projects, activities and investigations. This paper outlines the genesis of these relationships, how they began and fruitfully developed, and will provide a helpful case study for other organisations seeking to commence projects and cement alliances by answering the following questions: How does an organisation take the first steps to establishing collaboration? How does one align working practices? How does one secure trusted partners? What role do contracts and legal frameworks play in a multi-modal organisational setting that crosses political and legal jurisdictions?",

To better understand the current state of RDS in R1 and R2 university research libraries in the United States, how they have evolved since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, and who is providing these services, this research project built an interoperable dataset, LIbrary Data Services (LIDS) dataset, to inform RDS development and assessment. The dataset records data service area(s) (e.g., Research Data Management), fifteen data service types (e.g., data management\/data curation), and personnel and unit information gathered through website content analyses, alongside Carnegie Classification data. How can the data services community build on LIDS? While the focus for this research project is R1 and R2 university research libraries in the United States, similar studies have examined data services in libraries at other levels of American higher education (Radecki & Springer, 2019; Murray, et al., 2019; Yoon & Schultz, 2017), and academic and research libraries across Canada and the United States (Kouper, et al, 2017; Tenopir, et al., 2019), Europe (Tenopir, et al., 2017; Yu, 2017), Spain (Martin-Melon, et al., 2023), the United Kingdom (Cox & Pinfield, 2014), southern Africa (Chiware, 2020; Chiware & Becker, 2018), and globally (Cox, et al., 2019; Liu, et al., 2020; Reilly, 2012; Si, et al., 2019). How can we work together to change LIDS to I-LIDS, the International LIbrary Data Services dataset? Can we better reflect the post-COVID data services environment in higher education globally? This presentation will share the LIDS dataset with the international community to inform data services collaboration, service development, and assessment, and consider how they might want to expand the dataset to cover their region of the world.",

The presenters will discuss the process of guiding what began as an ad-hoc interest group into a large-scale, multi-faceted team to enable student learning about AI, based on gathered data. The team is co-led by two librarians, and consists of full-time library staff, instructional development staff, and student library workers. The team collaborates on a suite of projects that include: gathering and analyzing data about current use of AI on campus via a pop-up survey; an IRB survey; an interactive tutorial on the ethical use of AI in coursework; an AI tools resource guide; an external, campus workshop addressing algorithmic bias and bias in AI; and an internal, library workshop on AI in library instruction. Attendees will leave with an understanding of the project components; lessons learned; and insight on how the project outputs address diverse student perceptions and needs surrounding generative AI.",

          "abstract": "To the best of my knowledge, there has been limited research in the context of geospatial data librarianship into the growing trends in its data services, particularly in regard to research data management services (RDMS) and collaboration trends. While geospatial data is becoming increasingly important in addressing global concerns and enabling a wide range of applications, there is still a gap in understanding how developing RDMS interact with collaborative efforts in the geospatial data librarianship area. These services include the difficult curation, preservation, and accessibility of geospatial datasets, each with its own set of spatial and temporal dimensions. Collaboration emerges as a critical feature at multiple levels within this dynamic ecology. For instance, inter-multidisciplinary collaborations are becoming more important as geospatial data librarians collaborate with researchers from other professions to build tailored RDMS for specific domains. This will ensure that data management strategies fit the specific needs of each profession. Second, intra-institutional interactions within institutions become critical for efficient RDMS, mandating close collaboration between libraries, research centres, IT departments, and cartography units. Such arrangements help to ensure the seamless integration of geospatial data into the academic and research environments, as well as a uniform approach to data stewardship. Finally, cross-sectoral collaborations among academic institutions, government agencies, and industry stakeholders are critical in shaping geospatial data management policies, standards, and practices, fostering advancements in RDMS on regional, national, and international scales. Through an examination of these trends, the absence of research on this topic may reveal the diverse degrees of collaboration inherent in the evolving fashion of geospatial data librarianship as it relates to enabling users access to geospatial data. This, in turn, will foster progressions in the domain of librarianship, geospatial sciences and its extensive pragmatic applications.",

JEDI provides an online forum that has hosted numerous discussion threads on open science and journal editing. Drawing on information and materials provided in these discussions by its members, JEDI has also begun to compile a substantial collection of open science resources directed at journal editors. The community is organized by the Data Preservation Alliance for the Social Sciences (Data-PASS), a voluntary partnership of organizations created to archive, catalog, and preserve social science research data, and has received continued funding from the NSF. In this short talk, we will first present JEDI — how its origins, rooted in discussions on editorial processes concerning data, code, and their management — has evolved to encompass topics as diverse as citation practices, research transparency and accessibility, and peer review, among others. Then, we will share insights from JEDI’s three years of existence that we believe are applicable to other scientific communities as well: how to build and sustain community within academia, what challenges JEDI has encountered and how we have tackled them, and how open science plays a central role both as an objective and a guiding principle for JEDI.",

The idea of a secure library data archive was floated but despite support from Library Administration and the provision of storage space, we became mired down in endless conversations about procedure, ethics and data ownership. In 2022 an additional data crisis arose: our Research Ethics Board’s former recommended option for sharing sensitive data was being decommissioned and an unknown number of potentially restricted datasets were about to become homeless. That was the push needed and in 2023 the Library Secure Data Archive was launched. Come hear a story of data neglect, peculiar storage recommendations and The Form That Took Forever!",

          "abstract": "Having the skills to find informative data when developing and answering research questions is an important aspect of data literacy, and for the social sciences, these skills need to address issues related to data about race, gender, and underrepresented populations. I want to share an effort to bring in a critical data literacy component at a small, liberal arts college (Reed College) by exploring instructional opportunities and assessing student and faculty needs. We are also interested in questions about prior interest, subject relevance, and scaffolding in data instruction. Improving and integrating data literacy in curricula is vital to ensure that students with no background in data become capable of finding and interpreting the data they need in their field. Standalone units or workshops can also be effective, which in different libraries have run the gamut from special topics workshops to foundational data literacy 101s. The goal of this project is to map out and understand where among the students and programs at Reed can data literacy instruction live. Reed students are highly motivated and interested in social justice topics, which raises some questions: Would students be interested in the topic of data and social justice? Can using a social justice lens to teach about research data pique more interest? How can discussing the historical and political issues of data collection and discovery enhance students’ data literacy? What form should/ could such a session take and what would the learning objectives be? Can it serve as a module for different subject areas or is subject specificity a need? This talk will discuss the use of ad hoc student outreach activities, syllabi review, and faculty surveys; and possibly, blueprints for a workshop.",

With the FAIR Principles as common ground, we explore the current system of government information dissemination within the United States to see how FAIR Principles can be applicable to the complex ecosystem of federal government information. Following the guidance of the U.S. Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), federal agencies increasingly take into consideration FAIR Principles as part of practices to improve public access to federally-supported research data. However, information that has been produced by the government for public access also includes publications, websites, databases, and other forms of content, nearly all of which are now born-digital. Dissemination is subject to the guidelines of the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), but once it is published online, stewardship falls to a myriad of responsible agencies, depending on the specifics of the content. This leaves gaps in what is collected, described, made available, and preserved for future discovery and reuse. This talk will chart some of the boundaries and potential for future collaboration and partnership among practitioners and stakeholders.",

This study was born from the desire to understand how institutions have been planning for the future of RDM support in Canada. The RDM landscape in Canada has changed significantly in the past decade. The development of the Tri-Agency RDM Policy, changes in journal/publisher requirements, and an increased emphasis on open science have changed the way researchers are expected to manage their research data and, consequently, the types and volume of support they need and that are provided by institutions. The results of this study will help the Canadian RDM community gain a deeper understanding of the role libraries play in supporting RDM and the skills and experience desired when hiring RDM professionals. The findings could also help guide professional development initiatives and could be compared to Canadian LIS curricula to uncover gaps in training for the next generation of information professionals.",

          "abstract": "NYU IT and Data Services launched a new research repository, UltraViolet (made with InvenioRDM), in May 2022. Prior to opening the service, the curation team spent significant time planning and designing a transparent, interoperable workflow. Influenced by the collaborative curation model of the Data Curation Network, including their CURATE(D) steps, the team decided to use shared file and information management systems, with no crucial pieces of communication or tracking left in an individual’s email or personal documents. The workflow weaves together several tools, all of which were previously available and familiar to system users. Patrons begin by entering metadata about a deposit in a Qualtrics form, which feeds into Springshare’s LibAnswers portal. An available curator responds using a LibAnswers macro and supplies a Globus upload link; the researcher then adds their files. As the curator reviews the files and communicates with the researcher, they can use internal notes and templates in LibAnswers that incorporate DCN CURATE(D) checklists to ensure the curator stays attuned to crucial pieces of the curation workflow and maintains a log our whole team can access. All communication with the researcher (both emails and notes from conversations) also stays in LibAnswers, enabling other curators to pick up or refer back to the conversation. For large data, curators can also use an API to connect Globus directly to UltraViolet. This connection automatically loads data to the appropriate record in UltraViolet, transferring the files to our preservation repository while maintaining an ready access copy. Our poster will depict this workflow and point to some future refinements and improvements we hope to make, such as connections with other InvenioRDM tools and automations.",

In the ensuing 20 years, we’ve seen a proliferation of data literacy initiatives in higher education (often as a supplement to—and sometimes conflated with—the emergence of data science and data analytics as an academic discipline and an in-demand career path). Harkening back to Schield’s focus on the library, we want to explore the extent to which these burgeoning endeavors are centered in the library and staffed and maintained by librarians. Additionally, we hope to quantify, as of now, at what type of institution the library is most likely to take the lead in promoting data literacy. This poster will present initial findings from a comparison of data literacy initiatives at large research universities in North America (ARL members) with data literacy programs at undergraduate-focused liberal arts colleges in the same region. Other variables considered include the marketing and discoverability of data literacy programs; the involvement of other non-library campus units; the extent of data literacy training and instruction (including a for-credit option); and the focus and content of data literacy programs. Attendees’ reaction to these initial findings will help inform the path and direction of further lines of inquiry related to this topic.",

While increasingly information science professionals have a sense of best practices for data management and archiving, less attention is paid to the organization of non-data files that compliment research. There are a variety of digital files that support the program, this includes written documents pertaining to program development, training materials, contracts, and recruitment of participants. In our particular case, the service-learning program did not start out with a clear plan for organizing the data or the digital files. This presentation will share how we went from ad-hoc file organization to a more streamlined system, not only utilizing practices from research data management but also integrating ideas from personal knowledge management (PKM) and business \"self-help\" books.",

The poster will also discuss strategies to co-define and co-evaluate the concept of “open” with students in varying topics: (1) Open government policies and practices; (2) technological infrastructures that support open data; (3) ethics, privacy, and social justice. Embedding open government data perspectives in data literacy efforts–whether it’s a workshop or credit-bearing courses–provides a myriad of opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students to engage with the technical, legal, and ethical implications of working with civic data. In a credit-bearing course context, students can inspect the major laws and policies surrounding open government while also examining the social and technological challenges and advancements that shape the future of open data—for example, grassroots data intermediaries obtaining and “translating” open government data for a public audience. When a course is more computational or methods-oriented, open government data allows for students to explore the challenges and opportunities of working with data with varying levels of complexity and “cleanliness,” signifying and clarifying the importance and utilitarian role of metadata within the data lifecycle.",

Starting by leading an ongoing internal library discussion group - AI Intersection with Higher Education and the Academic Library - we developed an informal collaborative space to share ideas, concerns, experiences, and self-educate on the impact of AI on our work. This positioned the library within the larger campus to contribute to the response to AI tools, and provided a foundation for AI literacy workshops, which focused on fundamental knowledge of AI with emphasis on consumer level tools. The co-leads were especially mindful to include ethical implications, highlighting possible benefits and harms of AI tools. This poster will describe our experiences and challenges developing these initiatives. We will also highlight feedback from colleagues and learners, and share our future plans.",

Inspired by this revelation to conduct a contemporary reimagining, I propose a poster that investigates the potential and pitfalls of generative AI and then visualizes the results through a woven data physicalization. As generative AI rapidly advances, there continues to be a need to stay abreast in its applications and implications. In particular, I plan to investigate how well different generative AI products fare in answering various reference questions that a data librarian may be asked; how deep can a certain generative AI tool be asked to go, before it starts to hallucinate or lead to results not fitting the prompt? How well can it unearth datasets that meet a researcher’s very specific needs, when data can be embedded in a variety of places, some behind paywalls or low SEO? In homage to the long lineage of technology, the results of my investigation will be visualized by creating a textile-based data physicalization, where an accurate result will be woven with one colour and an inaccurate result in another. Each woven row will represent the results of a different reference question and AI product combination; the surrounding area of the poster will contain details of the question and product combination. Thus, technology again programs the textile’s pattern.",

In tech-time, this is ancient history! Over the last two years, ICPSR has been modernizing its data ingest and data delivery platforms. It’s not done yet, but lessons have already been learned! How does a 60+ year-old archive with a legacy of ingest, curation, dissemination, and specially-developed data technologies united together and interconnected in known and unknown ways reimagine and relaunch itself to meet research-data-sharing needs of today and of the future? The answer seems simple - talk to those \"using\" the data technologies. But then it gets complicated quickly. Who is a data user? Who else has key information that must be included? How does an organization combine user and user-support feedback, expert knowledge, and regulations to assist tech developers in navigating the future of research-data-sharing technology?

However, each new dataset acquisition presented its own unique challenges, and a variety of approaches for storage, discovery, and access (in accord with vendor requirements) were tested and implemented with mixed success. In addition, over the eleven years of the program, researchers' expectations regarding the DPP's budget, speed, and ongoing support began to exceed the DPP's scope, while data vendors became more sophisticated in their offerings and options. Waves of challenges--in acquiring data our researchers wanted, in maintaining the collection we already had, and in maintaining the personnel needed to support the collection--overwhelmed the DPP, and the program was discontinued in 2022. This poster will discuss the territories the DPP explored, the lessons learned, and how those lessons can inform future expeditions in data collection development, storage, discovery and access at Illinois and beyond.",

SLU's environmental data catalogue was built to enable a common and searchable web-based interface to the university's environmental monitoring data. The university already has a large amount of open research data, but finding data is a challenge as it is available in many different places such as webpages, data portals, and repositories, which of course makes it difficult for those who want to reuse data, for example for research purposes. The catalogue was launched in autumn 2022 and the ambition is to continuously collect descriptive information (metadata) on all data to provide a common entry point for data access via SLU's environmental data catalogue. So far we have received a positive response since the launch and we face the challenge of making the catalogue and the university's open data even more FAIR.",

          "abstract": "Introduction: The surge in open data platforms such as CKAN and Dataserve has expanded the urban data landscape, yet data scarcity persists due to inadequate metadata, poorly tailored data presentation, and localization challenges (Ojo et al., 2016). Decentralization of repositories further complicates data discovery and metadata inconsistencies and obstructs dataset identification, comparison, and deduplication. The Canadian Urban Data Catalogue (CUDC) addresses these issues by providing a comprehensive catalogue of both accessible and restricted Canadian urban datasets and web services. It incorporates a dataset metadata maturity model that ranks datasets by metadata completeness, where higher maturity denotes greater detail. Following Fox et al. (2024), the levels assess search-relevant attributes, extending to licensing, governance, and compliance with FAIR and indigenous data principles, ensuring a structured and mature metadata framework for catalogue entries. Methodology: The development of CUDC involves a user-centric approach, focusing on its users' practical needs and behaviours. The architecture integrates the maturity model with an advanced knowledge graph database for metadata analysis, developed as an open-source CKAN plugin that provides: 1. Cataloguing: a metamodel, extension support, upload capabilities, and API access points, ensuring accessible and transparent data access policies. 2. Search Functionality: a wide range of searchable metadata organized for easy data entry and retrieval. 3. Dataset Usage Quality: encourages comprehensive metadata provision for determining dataset applicability and relevance. 4. Search Behaviour Analysis: offers insights into dataset search models and tools, identifying key metadata across domains.

Statistical data tools like SAS, SPSS, and Stata and programming languages such as R and Python give data users powerful capabilities for data analysis. However, these tools have limited metadata capabilities. Colectica Datasets is a new tool that takes a metadata first approach to dataset creation, embedding DDI metadata into the data files themselves. Colectica Datasets can import SAS, SPSS, Stata, CSV, and Parquet files. Additional metadata about the dataset and its variables can be created by the user. Variable labels and value labels can be specified in multiple languages. The tool can then export the enhanced dataset to SPSS, Stata, CSV, Parquet, or Excel, and create summary statistics, weighted statistics, and codebook documentation. Users can run quality checks on their dataset which show alerts where additional metadata would be useful. In addition to embedding enriched metadata, Colectica Datasets can be used as a transfer tool between various statistical file formats. It automatically handles different types of missing values, format mapping, and data type detection. Colectica Datasets is free for personal use and available on Windows and macOS.",

          "abstract": "Participant consent for the secondary use of research data is a crucial element of the data lifecycle, and should be an important consideration in data curation and repository management practices. Canadian federal research ethics guidelines include numerous categories of information that should be provided to potential participants in order to establish that consent for unknown future uses of data, or broad consent, is informed. The volume of information conveyed during the consent process raises questions about participant engagement with and comprehension of the terms of consent and whether alternatives to written formats might be preferred by participants. To examine these questions, an anonymous survey was distributed to students at a Canadian undergraduate university designed to explore: how deeply students engage with consent information; whether a brief video describing procedures for, benefits, and risks of open data influences decisions to opt in or out of an open dataset; and whether those decisions are consistent with behaviours toward privacy and information security in other contexts. Preliminary results demonstrate low levels of engagement with the consent process; ineffectiveness of an explanatory video; largely altruistic motivations for participation in anonymous, open research; and attitudes toward personal data protection that are highly context-dependent. Further research in this area could support improvements to the open data consent process to add clarity and increase trust in research data management and sharing processes, and inform the development of institutional and repository policies around ethical data sharing.",

At our library, we decided it was crucial to increase our data services to better support researchers as they meet funder requirements, delve into open science, and improve data skills. This poster will depict the data service ecosystem we created, showcasing how pre-existing support, new services, and our goals for the future come together to create a web that supports the entire data lifecycle. In previous years, our data services focused on offering support in bibliometrics, open scholarship, and geospatial data. In the past year, we have expanded by creating a new data management and sharing support service and introducing new workshop offerings. These workshops range in topics from reproducibility, to metadata, AI, ArcGIS and mapping, and funder policies, culminating with a successful series on data visualizations. Finally, we supported our researchers with new software – launching a data and institutional repository and purchasing and supporting an electronic laboratory notebook. Our plan is to continue this momentum by expanding our data team with two inaugural positions, reproducibility librarian and data curator. This will help us offer tailored learning opportunities, design materials that cater to changing funder requirements, and explore additional research/data platforms. We are also building on partnerships with units across campus that work in synergistic areas including groups that specialize in graduate education, research, and open scholarship. This strategy includes bolstering our marketing efforts and increasing the visibility of our services. In addition, AI and machine learning are closely related to data, and we have a working group devising an AI recommendation for libraries. This poster will depict our data ecosystem, highlighting our current progress, upcoming initiatives, and future aspirations.",

In her pioneering study of the nascent state of qualitative supports in academic libraries, Swygart-Hobaugh (2016) even dubbed them the 'Jan Brady' of data services. As qualitative researchers, and leaders of research data services and social science support units at our respective libraries, we recognize this and believe our organizations are well positioned to support qualitative researchers throughout the research lifecycle. This poster will showcase our experiences establishing new qualitative research support services at Temple University Libraries and the University of Pennsylvania Libraries. We will discuss how we developed or restarted our services, from initial benchmarking and internal exploration to service launch, team staffing, and evaluation. Our two case studies demonstrate practical applications of suggestions made by past researchers, who have explored the visibility and accessibility of qualitative research support and the relationship between qualitative support, data literacy, and other research data services (Swygart-Hobaugh, 2016; Cain et al., 2019; Hagman & Bussell, 2022). We will describe how we acted upon their findings to enhance the discoverability of our libraries’ qualitative services, their educational impact, and their integration with other programs. This poster will yield practical insights to benefit other library, information, and data professionals launching new or developing existing qualitative research support services. We hope to inspire IASSIST 2024 attendees to consider how their organizations can navigate a research landscape where qualitative data and methods are increasingly valued.",

We will describe our best practices for collaboration and communication between GIS and IT staff and how that helped to create the best system for our users. The MIT Libraries first created access for users to our geospatial data collection in 2002, with an ESRI geodatabase and a desktop search interface written in Visual Basic. Subsequent generations of the collection and search tool evolved from locally coded search interfaces using open source tools to OpenGeoPortal and eventually to GeoBlacklight, with MIT Libraries engineers contributing to GeoBlacklight development. Throughout all of this, our geospatial collection remained separate from the rest of the MIT Libraries collections. Because of staffing and skill changes, technical limitations, and a desire to integrate all of our collections, MIT Libraries is currently moving from GeoBlacklight to a system directly integrated with other library systems and collections. The initial change will lose spatial search capabilities but will integrate our geospatial collection with other collections and will be powered by MIT Libraries’ TIMDEX search API. We are currently planning the next steps beyond the TIMDEX text search, which will include both spatial search capabilities and the ability to examine geospatial data before downloading it.",

For the Census of Canada modern era, there are two main gaps that remain for the 1961 and 1971 Censuses corresponding to local governments (municipalities), counties, and equivalent units in municipally unincorporated areas. These units are called Census Subdivisions (CSDs) and are nested within Census Divisions (CDs). Extraction of census data and boundaries using geographic information systems (GIS) supports data rescue and enables broad discovery and reuse across research disciplines.

DISSC addresses emerging needs common to the university’s social scientists and is a major step toward realizing one of Yale’s main university-wide academic priorities. As researchers across the social sciences continue to expand and capitalize on data use to study and address social problems, their needs for an infrastructure and support network have increased. Research support at Yale is distributed across campus by schools, departments, and centers, growing organically to meet the needs of their constituents. Over time this network has shown some gaps where disciplines or needs overlap and it could be challenging to navigate which service point is available to which researcher. This poster describes some of the activities during the first year of DISSC, including improvements to research infrastructure, data access, management, and discoverability, cross-campus collaboration, and interdisciplinary data use, which fall under several IASSIST topic areas.",

At the University of British Columbia’s Okanagan campus, the Library and Research Computing have partnered to build an array of supports – workshops, consultations, drop-ins, and online learning materials – designed to meet learners at their point of need and support them through the early stages of their research careers. Principles of RDM, transparency, and reproducibility are woven throughout, and each support is integrated with the next: learn foundational concepts for RDM, data analysis and statistical computing, as well as the tools to interface with HPC infrastructure at a workshop, book a consultation to map these to a specific project, revisit online materials for a refresher, and drop in to ask follow-up questions. This pilot project, funded through internal grants, provides experiential learning opportunities for graduate students, connects early career researchers with research support units, and bridges gaps in the transition from core subject area learning to computational approaches to expand the breadth of how research is conducted and disseminated. Our poster will discuss our experiences building relationships across research support units, how we’ve implemented our pilot, uptake across faculties, and future directions.",

          "abstract": "This poster will present a project that helped librarians learn and teach artificial intelligence (AI) tools for data de-identification. Librarians continue to play an important role in research data management services, offering crucial outreach and instruction to faculty and researchers about data tools, FAIR data, and open science. As AI tools continue to grow in use and popularity, information professionals are poised to offer guidance on data sharing in the AI landscape. Training librarians to train researchers in AI concepts and AI-based data tools helps increase librarian skills in both AI and data management. Data de-identification is a great example of a data management skill that is well suited to AI-based tools. Therefore, this one-hour webinar was created to introduce librarians and information professionals to AI and natural language processing (NLP), and provide fundamental context about how they work through the example of de-identification. Using a train-the-trainer model, this class explored openly available tools that use NLP to find and redact personally identifying information, and discussed the distinctions between privacy, de-identification, anonymization, and (USA-specific) HIPAA compliance. The removal and de-identification of personal and sensitive information is often a repetitive, time intensive process. These tools can be used to produce HIPAA compliant data that can be more safely shared and help researchers comply with data sharing policies. Teaching librarians about freely available data tools can improve their understanding of AI and expand their institution’s data service offerings. Although the workshop presented was focused on librarians, our planning process may be of interest to other trainers interested in introducing AI basics through practical tools. This presentation will describe curriculum development, highlighted tools, and results from a pilot run.",

Fundamentals of MAST & IDEAL Metadata is a short-course in the MAST/IDEAL Methodology, a pragmatic framework for building understanding and organisational support for data management through good processes rather than specific tools or standards.  The MAST/IDEAL Methodology is a standards-agnostic and tools-independent approach that supports existing frameworks such as the Data Management Body of Knowledge and DDI Data Lifecycle, which talk about what data practitioners must do, by providing a step-by-step guide on how practitioners can develop skills and culture to perform these tasks. This course will be delivered in a practioner-led group session, including:  Peer discussions on case studies highlighting existing challenges in change management and education in data governance Examination of sample templates for documenting data and how to adopt these for existing projects Peer discussions on the use of MAST & IDEAL for the selection of data standards and software As an emerging framework, following the course participants will be invited to provide feedback on the methods and frameworks presented to gather data on ongoing research into the framework. Participants will also be invited to complete an online quiz to receive a digital micro-certification to promote their own experience and knowledge.",

          "abstract": "A key component to any research project is data and making that data FAIR-compliant is our ultimate goal. However, many researchers today are creating minimal documentation of their data, maybe just enough to pass the requirements of the data management plan (DMP), and maybe the requirements of a data repository. In many situations, researchers may be relying on data repositories or archives to create the necessary documentation to make their data FAIR or are just not concerned about it. At the University of Guelph, we are encouraging and enabling our researchers to create data schemas at the start of their project (before data collection). The schemas are created using our Semantic Engine and the newly developed Overlays Capture Architecture. Data schemas may be stored, shared, edited, and are all uniquely identified. Imagine a large 5yr research project using the same data schemas and data entry forms across all their students and research associates? The time that can be saved when pooling all the data for analysis is immense. Imagine being able to confirm that the data you just discovered was indeed the one created by the Project Lead 10 years ago and not altered in anyway? This workshop will walk you through the development of the Semantic Engine tools and provide hands on experience creating your own data schemas. We will work with a sample dataset and demonstrate how we can build the layers of a schema, how they are uniquely identified, how you can share them, build upon an existing schema, and how we can create a data entry Excel file for the project. We will close the workshop with a discussion about current and future development and possible uses within the broader research ecosystem - just think how AI could use these schemas?",

Data curation enables data discovery and access, maintains data quality and authenticity, adds value, and provides for re-use over time through activities including open and controlled access, archiving, metadata creation, digital preservation, and file format transformation. There are many additional activities encompassed by the term data curation– which can be daunting for a novice to understand and apply in a meaningful way. The IASSIST & CARTO 2024 proposed Data Curation Network (DCN) and Digital Research Alliance of Canada co-hosted Data Curation Fundamentals training workshop will provide attendees with a framework for getting started with data curation, including hands-on practical curation training using various data formats . Using the DCN CURATE(D) workflow (z.umn.edu/curate) and the Canadian bilingual (English and French) CURATION framework, attendees will learn practical curation techniques that can be applied across research disciplines. Provided by members of the DCN Education Committee, and the Alliance’s Curation Expert Group (CEG) and invited speakers, this workshop will leverage both active learning opportunities, using example datasets, as well as discussions in an inclusive peer-to-peer learning environment. This established curriculum has been used for both in-person and virtual learning opportunities, with overwhelming success. This workshop has been taught in the United States, adapted and extended for use in Canada, and we are eager to bring our curriculum to the international community.",
