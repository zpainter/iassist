<p>Why Open Science is not enough<br /><br />The themes of Diversity in Research, FAIR and Open Science overlap and also diverge when we examine the expectations for what it means to be “open” with research across cultures, varied organizational practices, and the lived experience of marginalized populations (many of whom have been repeatedly abused by the research establishment). <br /><br />While Open Science and FAIR are familiar sets of transferable and robust processes to improve science everywhere, they are not enough. It is critical to recognize the full diversity of cultural values  with respect to participation in research and its outcomes. Rather than simply asserting the universal benefits of Open Science, as data professionals we must all be leaders through incorporating CARE data principles into our practice, our advising and teaching. <br /><br />The Global Indigenous Data Alliance developed CARE which stands for the Collective benefit, Authority to control, Responsibility, and Ethics of research, in 2018 to acknowledge that Indigenous Peoples’ rights and wellbeing should be the primary concern at all stages of the data life cycle and across the data ecosystem. We can argue here that to realize the full benefits promised by Open Science, we must equally attend to CARE principles. <br /><br />This roundtable is an opportunity to build on prior conversations about how we can be “as open as possible, and as closed as necessary” by also addressing questions regarding who benefits and at what cost?  Panelists will discuss experience and strategies for expanding CARE awareness into our Open Science practice. <br /><br />In short: Be FAIR and CARE when working toward Open Science.</p>
