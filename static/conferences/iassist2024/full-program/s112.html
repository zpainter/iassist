<p>The Data Documentation Initiative (DDI) is an international standard for describing the data produced by surveys and other observational methods in the social, behavioral, economic, and health sciences. DDI is a free standard that can document and manage different stages in the research data lifecycle. <br /><br />The DDI training materials provide an introduction to metadata and DDI, to those who are new to DDI - from the basics of ‘What is Metadata?’ to more detailed subjects like ‘Variables and the Variable Cascade’. They can be used for your own individual training to gain an understanding of different aspects of DDI, or re-used when developing training activities.<br /><br />The training materials were developed by the DDI Alliance Training Working Group, whose mission involves introducing people to DDI and improving people's competence in working with DDI. The resource has been published in the Zenodo community DDI Training materials (https://zenodo.org/communities/ddi_training_material) in the form of presentations, and includes a guide for how to use them. In addition, effort has been made to translate several presentations into French.<br /><br />The poster describes the DDI Training resource and how to use them for your own or others learning.</p>
