<p>The principles of transparency and accountability are important to the Government of Nova Scotia. The Nova Scotia Open Data Portal plays a key role in supporting these principles by hosting government datasets made available by various departments. However, to meet the demands and expectations for access to government data, insight into the needs of and the use of data and open data by the public, including, for example, librarians, researchers, students, entrepreneurs, and interested citizens, is vital.  <br /><br />User research was conducted in the Fall of 2023 to understand the needs and experiences of Nova Scotia Open Data Portal users and potential users and to find opportunities for future and continuous engagement. This presentation will describe the user research findings from an online survey, focus groups, and interviews as well as subsequent plans and efforts to support the Nova Scotia open data community and engage meaningfully.</p>
