<p>In the rapidly evolving domain of Artificial Intelligence (AI), understanding its ubiquity and impact across various sectors is crucial. This poster introduces the &quot;AI Ubiquity Dashboard,&quot; a first-of-its-kind tool designed to monitor and analyze the extensive deployment of AI. The dashboard offers a multi-dimensional view of AI integration, focusing on areas such as the diversity of AI applications, data collection methodologies, and the legislative landscape shaping AI usage. Key functionalities of the dashboard include tracking the deployment of AI in different states, categorizing AI applications (e.g., healthcare, finance, education), and examining data collection methods used in AI-driven software. It also keeps track of executive orders and legislation at both the state and federal levels in the United States, offering insights into how governance shapes AI deployment. Additional metrics incorporated into the dashboard address emerging areas of interest in how AI is applied. These include ethical AI usage metrics, Generative AI in education, and research metrics. The dashboard is a feature of the Cosmology of AI project, a project focused on developing and providing a friendly outward-facing visualization of the evolutionary structure of the field of AI.</p>
