<p>In the Summer / Fall 2004 issue of IASSIST Quarterly, Milo Schield presented a strong case for the role of academic librarians to promote and provide instruction in data literacy, noting its interrelation with both information literacy and statistical literacy. In the ensuing 20 years, we’ve seen a proliferation of data literacy initiatives in higher education (often as a supplement to—and sometimes conflated with—the emergence of data science and data analytics as an academic discipline and an in-demand career path). <br /><br />Harkening back to Schield’s focus on the library, we want to explore the extent to which these burgeoning endeavors are centered in the library and staffed and maintained by librarians. Additionally, we hope to quantify, as of now, at what type of institution the library is most likely to take the lead in promoting data literacy.<br /><br />This poster will present initial findings from a comparison of data literacy initiatives at large research universities in North America (ARL members) with data literacy programs at undergraduate-focused liberal arts colleges in the same region. Other variables considered include the marketing and discoverability of data literacy programs; the involvement of other non-library campus units; the extent of data literacy training and instruction (including a for-credit option); and the focus and content of data literacy programs. Attendees’ reaction to these initial findings will help inform the path and direction of further lines of inquiry related to this topic.</p>
