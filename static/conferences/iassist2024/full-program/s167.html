<p>The Digital Research Alliance of Canada’s Data Management Planning Expert Group (DMPEG) develops and delivers publicly available DMP-related guidelines, best practices, content, and resources for supporting researchers and research excellence across Canada, including DMP templates, examples, and guidance materials. Additionally, DMPEG supports the ongoing development, maintenance, and sustainability of DMP Assistant, a freely available bilingual web-based tool providing templates, questions, and guidance for supporting researchers with their DMP needs. This session provides an overview of DMPEG activities and resources, notably focusing upon a new DMP template that has been developed specifically to support researchers in meeting DMP requirements at the funding application stage, including those implemented by the Tri-Agency, Canada’s national funders of research across the Social, Health, and Natural Sciences. An overview of the template and its content, including key guidance and questions, and how to access and use it within DMP Assistant, will be provided. Additionally, a description of the template development process, including review and feedback processes with key stakeholder groups such as the DMP Assistant Administrators Group, Tri-Agency colleagues, and the Alliance RDM Network of Experts will be discussed. A DMP assessment rubric corresponding to the new template, and aiming to be released by Spring 2024, will also be discussed, along with additional resources developed by DMPEG, including DMP examples, as well as future work and directions, including with respect to the DMP Assistant platform.</p>
