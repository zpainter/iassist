<p>At universities, research involving data is often regarded as the domain of graduate students and faculty.  Undergraduate students also work with data within the research process, and it can be a core experience to prepare for future education and careers.  Research products from undergraduate students can also demonstrate the extent of their data literacy skills and understanding, which are becoming central to success in graduate work and the business world.  Since one main way undergraduate students share research is through posters, this session will examine undergraduate posters in the context of data literacy skills.  <br /><br />During the session we will define data literacy and discuss why it is important for undergraduate students to develop.  We will review the structure of undergraduate poster competitions and other opportunities for undergraduate research.  Finally, we will share results on the strengths and gaps in data literacy, followed by suggestions for supporting and encouraging undergraduate research and data literacy development beyond the traditional area of data analysis.</p>
