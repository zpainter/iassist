<p>Ada Lovelace, often heralded as the first computer programmer, saw the potential in Charles Babbage’s Analytical Engine by comparing its possibilities beyond number-crunching with that of the mechanical loom, which used mechanical binary punchcards to weave intricately patterned fabric. Inspired by this revelation to conduct a contemporary reimagining, I propose a poster that investigates the potential and pitfalls of generative AI and then visualizes the results through a woven data physicalization.<br /><br />As generative AI rapidly advances, there continues to be a need to stay abreast in its applications and implications. In particular, I plan to investigate how well different generative AI products fare in answering various reference questions that a data librarian may be asked; how deep can a certain generative AI tool be asked to go, before it starts to hallucinate or lead to results not fitting the prompt? How well can it unearth datasets that meet a researcher’s very specific needs, when data can be embedded in a variety of places, some behind paywalls or low SEO?<br /><br />In homage to the long lineage of technology, the results of my investigation will be visualized by creating a textile-based data physicalization, where an accurate result will be woven with one colour and an inaccurate result in another. Each woven row will represent the results of a different reference question and AI product combination; the surrounding area of the poster will contain details of the question and product combination. Thus, technology again programs the textile’s pattern.</p>
