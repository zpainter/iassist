<p>Reflecting on the history of Research Data Management (RDM) in Canada, we can gain insights and inspiration for developing new RDM services, infrastructure and charting new pathways. In the Canadian academic community, RDM is often supported by data specialists and librarians, and has developed an advanced service structure based on academic libraries and regional networks before a national RDM service was introduced. The range of support, which includes online tools, guides, training, consultations, research data repositories, and collegial networks, has grown dramatically over the past ten years. <br /><br />Canada is a large, geographically diverse and bilingual country with five distinct regions (Atlantic, Central, Prairie, West Coast, and North) where regional grass-roots support has grown into nationally coordinated services. The Digital Research Alliance of Canada (Alliance) has integrated RDM as an area of focus and is leading and coordinating the Canadian research community through the new era of infrastructure and service development. Looking ahead, the continuing contributions from research institutions, regional groups, and the Alliance will all be necessary to bring Canadian RDM support to a new level, along with more comprehensive consideration and inclusion of data management support to research on our Indigenous populations. <br /><br />The presentation will draw on the content of a chapter in a recent open-access book, &quot;Research Data Management in the Canadian Context: A Guide for Practitioners and Learners&quot;, which focuses on the national and regional development of RDM in Canada. Authors from across Canada contributed to the open-access book, which is in use both in RDM training and Library and Information Science classes to educate and inform future and current data professionals. The book is released in both English and French, the official languages of Canada.</p>
