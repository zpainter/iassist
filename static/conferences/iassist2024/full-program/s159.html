<p>The discovery and access of historical and contemporary census data for use in research poses significant challenges in Canada. With distributed discovery and access portals including government, archives, libraries, and research projects, this necessitates collaborative efforts among various stakeholders. This panel aims to present a comprehensive overview of the Canadian Census Data Discovery Partnership (CCDDP), a SSHRC funded partnership project (2020-2023), focused on bringing together census data stakeholders, disseminators, and stewards, aiming to discuss challenges, innovations, and collaborative initiatives developed to enhance the discoverability and access to Canadian census data. Experts from key stakeholders groups, including the Library and Archives Canada (LAC), CCDDP project committee, and Statistics Canada, will provide unique insights into their contributions and experiences, underscoring the critical need for collective stewardship of valuable census data in Canada.<br /><br />CCDDP Project Overview: This presentation will delve into the CCDDP's comprehensive census data inventory (1666-2021) and user needs analysis, shedding light on the current state of census data discovery and access. Additionally, it will showcase the prototype of the census data discovery portal, developed as a solution for finding historical and contemporary census data in Canada, emphasizing its role as a distributed discovery tool for users.<br /><br />LAC Census Search: This segment will feature insights from Library and Archives Canada on the challenges and successes encountered in facilitating the discovery and access to census data. The presentation will highlight the importance of effective data management and search tools, and the role of the LAC Census Search in this context.<br /><br />Statistics Canada: This section will explore the innovative census data dissemination tools and access models introduced by Statistics Canada. A representative from Statistics Canada will share insights into the latest strategies and technologies employed to enhance data dissemination, facilitating improved access for a broader user base.</p>
