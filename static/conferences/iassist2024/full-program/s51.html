<p>NYU IT and Data Services launched a new research repository, UltraViolet (made with InvenioRDM), in May 2022. Prior to opening the service, the curation team spent significant time planning and designing a transparent, interoperable workflow. Influenced by the collaborative curation model of the Data Curation Network, including their CURATE(D) steps, the team decided to use shared file and information management systems, with no crucial pieces of communication or tracking left in an individual’s email or personal documents. The workflow weaves together several tools, all of which were previously available and familiar to system users. Patrons begin by entering metadata about a deposit in a Qualtrics form, which feeds into Springshare’s LibAnswers portal. An available curator responds using a LibAnswers macro and supplies a Globus upload link; the researcher then adds their files. As the curator reviews the files and communicates with the researcher, they can use internal notes and templates in LibAnswers that incorporate DCN CURATE(D) checklists to ensure the curator stays attuned to crucial pieces of the curation workflow and maintains a log our whole team can access. All communication with the researcher (both emails and notes from conversations) also stays in LibAnswers, enabling other curators to pick up or refer back to the conversation. For large data, curators can also use an API to connect Globus directly to UltraViolet. This connection automatically loads data to the appropriate record in UltraViolet, transferring the files to our preservation repository while maintaining an ready access copy.  Our poster will depict this workflow and point to some future refinements and improvements we hope to make, such as connections with other InvenioRDM tools and automations.</p>
