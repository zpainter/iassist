<p>This talk will discuss our analysis of RDM job postings in Canadian academic libraries over the last decade. Specifically, we explored the following research questions: (1) what terminology is used; (2) what are the requirements listed; (3) what are the responsibilities and characteristics of the positions; (4) have there been changes over time; and (5) how do our findings compare to similar studies?<br /><br />This study was born from the desire to understand how institutions have been planning for the future of RDM support in Canada. The RDM landscape in Canada has changed significantly in the past decade. The development of the Tri-Agency RDM Policy, changes in journal/publisher requirements, and an increased emphasis on open science have changed the way researchers are expected to manage their research data and, consequently, the types and volume of support they need and that are provided by institutions.  <br /><br />The results of this study will help the Canadian RDM community gain a deeper understanding of the role libraries play in supporting RDM and the skills and experience desired when hiring RDM professionals. The findings could also help guide professional development initiatives and could be compared to Canadian LIS curricula to uncover gaps in training for the next generation of information professionals.</p>
