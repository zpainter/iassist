<p>Ukrainian Canadians began to settle in western Canada in 1892. Settlement occurred in 'blocks' – farm-sized quarter sections demarcated by the Dominion Lands Survey. Block settlement allowed the new migrants to settle among family and communities and contributed to the growth of a strong Ukrainian Canadian community. This was initially preferred by immigration and land agents, as it made their work easier, but the practice soon fell out of favour. Despite government opposition, Ukrainians continued to settle in these same patterns, establishing the Ukrainian Canadians as one of main ethnic groups that contributed to the development of the newly established Western Canada and Dominion of Canada.<br /><br />This project will use census data along with archival and genealogical documents to create an interactive map showing the movement of Ukrainians to and across Canada throughout their 130-year period of immigration. Most of the demographic information about the history of Ukrainian block settlement is contained in static thematic maps that were published over 30 years ago. With the addition of census data, these maps can be transformed into dynamic and interactive objects.<br /><br />This project seeks to preserve the historically significant research on Ukrainian immigrant block settlements with the creation of an openly accessible geospatial resource that includes historic and contemporary census data. This interactive mapping project will be a valuable resource for researchers, educators, and the general public interested in exploring the multifaceted narrative of Ukrainian immigration in Canada.</p>
