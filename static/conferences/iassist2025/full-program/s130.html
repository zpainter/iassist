<p>All research data should be FAIR—Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable—and as open as possible. However, much research data includes personal data, which is subject to GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation). Many researchers are concerned that GDPR may conflict with the FAIR principles, especially regarding the sharing, accessibility, and reusability of personal data. This presentation demonstrates how personal data can be both legally compliant and FAIR when GDPR is correctly applied.<br /><br />We will explore key aspects of GDPR that are particularly relevant to research, including exceptions that allow for data storage and archiving beyond standard retention periods. The presentation will also cover potential legal bases for processing personal data in research.<br /><br />To ensure that research data is both FAIR and GDPR-compliant, researchers are encouraged to conduct a GDPR assessment early in their projects, select the appropriate legal basis for processing data, and maintain transparency with participants about how their data will be used.<br /><br />This session will address common challenges and offer practical advice on planning and documenting research processes to ensure data is accessible, protected, and ready for sharing and reuse in compliance with relevant regulations. By understanding the flexibilities offered by the GDPR, researchers can ensure that their data meets both legal requirements and the FAIR principles.<br /><br />This presentation will explore how to balance data accessibility with privacy concerns while ensuring compliance with both FAIR and GDPR frameworks. Attendees will leave with actionable strategies for aligning research practices with these standards, ensuring data is legally compliant and reusable.</p>
