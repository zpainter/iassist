<p>OpenAIRE offers a comprehensive suite of advanced services aimed at augmenting the capabilities of research librarians by providing tools that enhance data management, accessibility, and analysis. This poster delves into how OpenAIRE services significantly benefit research librarians, empowering them to advocate for open science and elevate research outcomes.<br /><br />OpenAIRE services extend support throughout the entire research lifecycle, from planning to dissemination. A prime example is the Argos platform, which streamlines the creation and management of Data Management Plans (DMPs). Argos facilitates compliance with FAIR data principles, rendering DMPs actionable and interconnected with broader research outputs. This enables librarians to assist researchers in managing data effectively while ensuring long-term accessibility and adherence to funding mandates.<br /><br />Additionally, OpenAIRE CONNECT equips librarians with tools to build tailored research gateways, enhancing the discovery and dissemination of scholarly work. This service not only improves thematic discovery and boosts the visibility of research outputs but is also customizable to align with institutional branding, thereby reinforcing institutional identity. Furthermore, OpenAIRE MONITOR provides librarians with advanced analytics capabilities, enabling them to track and assess the impact of research activities across various dimensions. This supports evidence-based decision-making and strategic planning, which are crucial for the sustainability of research institutions.<br /><br />Moreover, OpenAIRE EXPLORE provides extensive access to a diverse array of scholarly outputs, aiding librarians in efficiently cataloging and distributing knowledge. Zenodo ensures the archiving of research data, maintaining its accessibility and citability. Meanwhile, OpenAPC promotes transparency in managing publication costs, facilitating informed financial decisions.<br /><br />In essence, OpenAIRE enhances librarians' roles as knowledge stewards by offering innovative tools for managing, supporting, and disseminating open science practices. By aligning with open science initiatives, these services not only bolster institutional research capacities but also underscore the vital role of research librarians in promoting transparency, reproducibility, and broader dissemination of scholarly work.</p>
