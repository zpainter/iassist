<p>At our institution, support for qualitative research and pedagogy has been limited and inconsistent, which echoes the findings of Swygart-Hobaugh (2016), now almost ten years later. As we hope to build out more consistent and sustainable services and programming, much like Castello, Kellam, and Tran (2024), we have been conducting a qualitative research study to identify researchers, practitioners, and instructors at our university to better understand common workflows, tools, and approaches. To better support discussions on metadata and open knowledge for qualitative data at our institution, we are interested in understanding data storage practices and avenues of publications, as well as how and what data sources are used in teaching.<br /><br />As we share our results and findings, we would love to invite fellow attendees to engage in some creative speculation with us to expand our services and programs to support researchers, practitioners, and instructors who are coming from varied disciplines. We aim to collate our findings and discussions to design programming that will help create better connections and collaborations across campus with folx who are interested in and/or have been doing qualitative work.</p>
