<div id="oc_program_summary_main"><h1 style="text-align:center">Reproducibility and future challenges: Labour market inequalities using UK Census data</h1>

<p>The UK Census has long been a cornerstone of social science research, providing a standardised and comprehensive dataset for the analysis of societal issues such as labour market inequalities. This poster explores the reproducibility of a study of employment disparities using the 2021 UK Census, focusing on differences by gender, ethnicity, immigration status and geographical region. Adhering to the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles, this analysis uses robust methodologies and open tools, ensuring that the results can be replicated and extended by researchers and policy makers. The main findings reveal significant disparities in employment rates, income levels and occupational representation, highlighting the systemic challenges to achieving equitable labour market outcomes.<br /><br />Going forward, the UK's potential transition from a traditional census to a reliance on local administrative data poses significant challenges in terms of reproducibility and consistency. Administrative data sources often vary in terms of definitions, coverage and accessibility, raising concerns about their granularity and comparability over time and between regions. This is likely to exacerbate data gaps and biases, particularly for under-represented groups, as well as complicating the replication of studies and the formulation of evidence-based policies.<br /><br />This poster highlights the essential role of standardised national datasets, such as the UK Census, in promoting reproducibility and comparability. It describes the future challenges associated with the transition to administrative data and proposes strategies to mitigate these risks, including investment in data standardisation, metadata development and integrated data infrastructures. In addressing these issues, the research highlights the importance of maintaining robust and accessible data sets to support informed decision-making and equitable social policies.</p>
