<div id="oc_program_summary_main"><h1 style="text-align:center">Trends in the use of academic repositories and social networks in promoting LIS and Communication scholar papers</h1>

<p>The aim of the poster is to analyse the habits of researchers and librarians when promoting their work through repositories and academic social networks in the fields of Information, Documentation and Communication. Repositories are also used for preservation and early publication (preprints) of journal articles. A bibliographic review, an online survey,  interviews with experts, and an analysis of the evolution of some repositories have been carried out. As results I would mention: Thematic repositories,  which  were  widely  used  20  years  ago,  are  now  facing  competition  from  institutional  repositories  (IR)  and academic  social  networks  such  as ResearchGate, Academia.edu and  others.  A  continued  decrease  in  the  number  of deposits in the e-LIS (Eprints in Library and Information Science) and MPRA(Munich Personal RePEc Archive) repositories has been observed in recent years, which seems to be due to the fact that many universities have published mandates that force professors to archive their work in their IR. Another important cause of the decrease in deposits is the greater availability  of  open  access  journals  in  recent  years,  which  has  made  it  less  necessary  to  archive  articles  in  repositories. Academic social networks, on the other hand, are perceived as more dynamic, allowing interaction with other authors, and not requiring the introduction of so much metadata to upload documents.</p>
