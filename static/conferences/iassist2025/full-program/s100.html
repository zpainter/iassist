<p>As law libraries increasingly engage with data-driven scholarship, launching data services requires navigating uncharted waters of research culture, stakeholder needs, and institutional priorities. This lightning talk will share how the NYU Law Library is charting its course in developing data services, focusing on early-stage efforts to understand research needs, define the scope of services, and address challenges.
The talk will also highlight strategies for information gathering, such as surveys and outreach, to better understand the data-related priorities of faculty and students. A critical part of this process has been liaising with the central NYU Libraries’s data services team and collaborating with other library departments to leverage existing expertise and resources. Additionally, engaging with diverse stakeholders, including technology departments and administrative teams, has been key to building partnerships. 
We will discuss opportunities identified during this process, such as supporting data literacy education and facilitating early data management best practices, alongside challenges like resource constraints and varying levels of data literacy.
Attendees will gain practical insights from NYU Law Library’s experiences in laying the groundwork for data services, including tips for defining the role of data services in their own institutions, starting small, and building momentum for future initiatives. This lightning talk offers a roadmap for law libraries navigating the complexities of establishing themselves as leaders in the evolving world of data-driven legal scholarship.</p>
