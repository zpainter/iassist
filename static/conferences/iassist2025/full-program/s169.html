<p>As the OSF Data Detective, your goal is to explore the OSF to track down an important piece of research, where it was created, and, of course, whodunit!<br /><br />The OSF Data Detective is played on a board representing the OSF with various communities that are utilizing the OSF infrastructure (like rooms in Clue). Each community is dedicated to a different field of study or initiative. Players take on the roles of data detectives, navigating through the OSF to collect clues. These clues are represented by ORCID identifiers for researchers, Digital Object Identifiers (DOIs) for pieces of research, and Research Organization Registry (ROR) for institutions. The goal is to determine which specific research (DOI) we need to cite, which researcher (ORCID) created it, and from which institution (ROR) it originated.<br /><br />Components:
- Game Board: Illustrates the OSF communities.
- Cards: Include ORCID IDs, DOIs, and RORs.
- Player Pieces: Different data detectives.
- Detective Notes: For tracking clues.
- Envelope: Holds the secret solution cards.<br /><br />Setup:
Secretly select a DOI, ORCID, and ROR card, placing them in the envelope.
Shuffle and distribute remaining cards among players, with extras in the Research Commons.
Players select their piece and start at the conference entrance.<br /><br />Gameplay:<br /><br />Roll a die to move and enter communities, making hypotheses about the research, researcher, and institution.
Upon entering a community, suggest a DOI, ORCID, and ROR combination. Other players reveal if they have any cards from the suggestion.
Use Detective Notes to track revealed information.<br /><br />Forming a Citation and Winning:
Players who think they've solved the case form a citation, stating their solution and checking the envelope.
Correct solutions win the game; incorrect guesses end the player's ability to suggest but not to participate in revealing cards.
The winner successfully identifies the correct research, researcher, and institution.</p>
