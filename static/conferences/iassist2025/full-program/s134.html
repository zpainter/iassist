<p>The Slovenian &quot;SPOZNAJ&quot; project aligns with the broader European movement towards open science. In line with European guidelines, Slovenia has enacted key legislation to promote open science: the Scientific Research and Innovation Activities Act (2021), the Resolution on the Scientific Research and Innovation Strategy of Slovenia 2030 (2022), and the Regulation on the Implementation of Scientific Research in Alignment with the Principles of Open Science and the Action Plan for Open Science (2023). These legislative actions require those involved in scientific research to ensure open access to research results, apply responsible evaluation of research work, and engage citizens in research activities.
The goal of the SPOZNAJ project is to accelerate the adoption of open science practices among project partners, contributing to the digital transformation of scientific research. The project aims to share knowledge and experiences related to open science and disseminate them to various stakeholders, including public infrastructure institutes, research agencies, privately owned higher education and research institutes, commercial sector researchers, private researchers, and the wider public.
In 2024, the SPOZNAJ project consortium delivered training for future data stewards, beginning with the preparation of a Catalogue of Competences for Data Experts, which served as the foundation for a three-week training program. In addition to the training sessions, the project has published two handbooks on Open Science and Research Data Management Planning in Slovenian. A significant achievement of the project is the creation of a Data Stewardship Network, which officially began operations in December 2024.
Presentation will address the following challenges: 
1) Terminology in Slovenian: Adapting complex open science concepts to the Slovenian language.
2) Lack of Expert Lecturers: Shortage of qualified instructors for open science and data stewardship training.
3) Implementing Open Science Principles: Ensuring the adoption of open science practices across all research-performing organizations in Slovenia.</p>
