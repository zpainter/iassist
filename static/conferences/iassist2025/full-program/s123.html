<p>As a digital archivist I collect materials from South Africans that have been involved in the Antarctic region. This material covers the history of South Africa’s involvement reveal important insights on the relationship of science and research done by South Africans.
Diaries, description of images, letters, journal articles and documents are a huge source of information. Since 2009 material has been collected for the digital archive. Digital archiving of material for the Antarctic Legacy of South Africa repository has a lot to do with correct metadata and assessment and evaluation of material and need for understanding South African involvement in the Antarctic region is of utmost importance. Especially in the South Africa context ALSA has the responsibility to establish the correct date and history timeline of involvement. These factors led to in depth study of documentation and images to create a timeline since before the heroic age. The timeline started from a low impact for an exhibition and pan out to be part of the digital museum, posters for established museums, public lectures to specific groups.  Initially these timelines focussed on the bases and the vessels. Since 2020 a renewed interest in South Africa’s participation and collaboration in research has come forward. As archivist I have worked through documents already available on the archive to establish the timeline of research within the Antarctic region. In this presentation I shall highlight these timelines and how events in the world and South Africa had an influence on these timelines. This research timeline may lead to more research within the social sciences and humanities.
ALSA has been maintaining the repository on DSPACE for more than a decade. The contribution of human involvement is more than pictures and diaries left behind, their work and life can enhance our perceptions of the polar environment.</p>
