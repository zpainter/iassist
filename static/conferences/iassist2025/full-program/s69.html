<p>Inspired by other projects such as the GESIS Panel, the Center for Social Research and Data Archives (CSRDA) at the Institute of Social Science of the University of Tokyo launched a longitudinal survey, the SSJDA Panel, based on a probability sample nationwide in 2021. As a part of advancing the open science environment in social sciences, the SSJDA Panel has conducted surveys twice a year (October and February) and solicited question proposals across the world. While secondary data analysis has been pervasive in social sciences in Japan since the SSJDA started its service in the late 1990s, there have been fewer chances for researchers in their early careers to design and conduct probability-based sample surveys. That is our primary motivation for constructing an international collaborative research platform that is particularly suitable for young scholars. Furthermore, we have disseminated the completed datasets as soon as possible through the SSJDA to promote secondary analysis as well. In the current presentation, we introduce the overview of the SSJDA Panel and its research data management in the data life cycle. Also, we share and discuss the current issues to be addressed and prospects for the sustainability of the panel.</p>
