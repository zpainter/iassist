<p>We are in a world where data-driven research shapes policy and public understanding and the significance of meticulous documentation and reproducibility cannot be overstated. Our presentation will focus on the documentation process related to our recently published dataset Voter Registration, Turnout, and Partisanship. This dataset contains counts of registered voters, ballots cast, and voting-eligible population by county in the United States. The National Neighborhood Data Archive (NaNDA) at the University of Michigan compiled and cleaned this dataset to serve as a valuable resource for researchers examining the intricate relationships among voter behavior and demographic factors.
NaNDA aims to provide geographic information in an accessible format, breaking down barriers that can hinder the integration of spatial data into social science research. We facilitate seamless linkage to other datasets by making data available in familiar tabular formats. Our commitment to clear documentation and  reproducibility is reflected in all our work, allowing researchers to build upon existing work rather than recreate it from scratch. This commitment also allows for the continuity of updated datasets as new data becomes available, keeping our work evergreen and relevant. The open-access nature of NaNDA's datasets ensures that researchers can easily download and utilize our data from platforms such as ICPSR, while also making it increasingly accessible through partnerships with institutions like the Michigan Center on the Demography of Aging (MiCDA) and the Michigan Medicine DataDirect portal.
In this presentation, we will illustrate how robust documentation and reproducibility not only accelerate the research process but also foster a collaborative environment that advances social science inquiry. NaNDA is paving the way for impactful research that is both transparent and replicable, seeking to exemplify the future of geographic data services in social research.</p>
