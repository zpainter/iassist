<p>Providing open access to research data increases the reliability and efficiency of the scientific process, as it allows research results to be reproduced, replicated, and re-used. The European Open Science Cloud (EOSC) develops a web of FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable) data and services for science in Europe. Trustworthy Digital Repositories (TDRs) providing long-term preservation services are essential for achieving a sustainable EOSC. The three-year EU-funded FIDELIS project, which started in January 2025, aims to establish a healthy, vibrant, and self-sustaining network of TDRs that will foster a supportive open science environment and guarantee FAIR data sharing also in the future. FIDELIS will also advance harmonisation and interoperability across repositories, strengthen the repositories and enable expansion of the network through active training and support programmes. 
This talk will build on our vision of how a TDR network could unite the repository community beyond ambitious but finite project efforts and offer a coordination and networking mechanism for addressing common challenges like sustainability. We will present preliminary results from a repository landscape analysis survey, provide an overview of the characteristics, functions, and activities exhibited across a broad range of repositories, and discuss how we can reach a clear and shared consensus on what constitutes a TDR in the context of EOSC. The talk will also describe how FIDELIS will engage with the community of repositories that are diverse in terms of maturity, domain, geographical location, and targeted users. We will conclude with an introduction to the project’s main routes for upskilling repositories and assisting them in achieving trustworthiness: cascading grants, training, and mentoring programmes.</p>
