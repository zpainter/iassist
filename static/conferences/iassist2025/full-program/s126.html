<div id="oc_program_summary_main"><h1 style="text-align:center">Unlocking the potential of standardised scales through metadata</h1>

<p>Standardised scales, also known as summated scales or validated 
questionnaires, are a group of related questions that measure an underlying 
concept. These scales are valuable research tools as they are cost-and time-
effective to implement, and allow researchers to reliably measure concepts 
across samples and over time. The use of standardised scales also enhances the 
comparability of research data.
However, finding information (i.e. metadata) about standardised scales is 
challenging and time-consuming. Information is typically scattered across 
multiple sources and documents, if available at all, and permission is sometimes
required to access the scale. Additionally, some scales have multiple versions 
that include a subset of the original items, and it can be difficult to trace these 
versions back to the original. It is also difficult to find information about where 
these scales have been used in existing research.
CLOSER aims to address these challenges by making information on multiple 
standardised scales openly accessible to researchers. We have gathered and 
documented up-to-date, comprehensive metadata about the scales used in the 
CLOSER Discovery studies in one centralised, publicly available platform: 
CLOSER Discovery. Users can now find information about the name, citation, 
question items (both the original and other versions), topics measured (e.g. 
alcohol consumption, physical health, depression), and their usage in the 
CLOSER Discovery study questionnaires and datasets for 10 standardised 
scales. We are preparing to add metadata for an additional 10 scales to CLOSER
Discovery in early 2025. To our knowledge, CLOSER Discovery is the only 
platform providing such detailed metadata on standardised scales, enabling 
researchers to identify where scales and used both within and across studies.
This poster will describe the process of creating comprehensive standardised 
scale metadata, the benefits of this metadata for researchers, and our future 
plans.</p>
