<p>With the increased adoption of generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools by the general public, there is a clear need for information professionals to adapt current information and data literacy frameworks to encompass the unique considerations presented by AI. Information literacy education has had to evolve numerous times as technology alters how professionals teach the general public about accessing information, data, and now, AI generated content. As we move towards a future where AI generated content is increasingly available, we must build upon existing data and information literacy frameworks in order to ensure that professionals, enthusiasts, and greater communities can navigate and critically analyze information presented to them, regardless of how it was created.<br /><br />This lightning talk will consist of a review of existing literature and frameworks from multiple fields and an overview of the authors’ creation of an AI literacy toolkit which data professionals, librarians, and academics can incorporate into information and data literacy sessions. Without an understanding of how AI generates responses, the perceived authority of large language models (LLMs) such as Chat-GPT could accelerate the spread of misinformation.<br /><br />The authors’ toolkit on teaching about generative AI will enable learners to critically evaluate the responses, sources, and potential biases inherent within AI tools. This toolkit will provide data and information professionals with a pre-made set of materials– including infographics, mini-lesson plans, and interactive activities they can use to interface with the general public regarding AI literacy. Through providing this toolkit, the authors aim to bridge the knowledge gap between information professionals and non-practitioners and increase understanding of AI and LLMs, which should facilitate better decision making regarding future implementations of AI tools.</p>
