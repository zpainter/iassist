<p>Trusted Research Environments (TRE) are physical or digital environments designed to allow access to confidential data. Access to this data is core to social sciences research, which is why securing access has emerged as such as a challenge at LSE, a specialist institution with a focus on the social sciences.<br /><br />The solution has been the development of the Datalibrary service at LSE, which has worked to meet rapidly rising demand for access to secure data, and worked with partners to develop various TRE solutions, both physical and digital. The team is also an integral part of the licensing and application process, liaising on behalf of researchers with our Legal, Cyber Security, and Data and Technology Services. <br /><br />What makes the Datalibrary at LSE unique is our focus on widening access to confidential data outside of the Academy, in line with our purpose as a National Research Library. This has principally been done via the SafePod service, delivered in collaboration with the ESRC funded SafePod Network (SPN). However, the SafePod has been overbooked since the closure of the ONS Safe Rooms in 2021, which left the LSE as one of the only access points to secure data in London. In response, we are working with the SPN to expand our offer via the opening of the SafePoint Hub, which is due to open in 2025. <br /><br />In this session we’ll look at how the library has developed, the practicalities for space and financial resourcing, how we’ve worked with our partners to develop the service and how we plan to expand in future. We’ll look at the challenges we’ve faced in delivery, both in terms of the financial costs and staff time, the lessons we’ve learned along the way and will share advice for anybody looking to develop a similar service in future.</p>
