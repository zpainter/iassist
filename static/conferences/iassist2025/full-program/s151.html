<div id="oc_program_summary_main"><h1 style="text-align:center">Bridging evaluation and implementation: Using results from a survey of research data repository administrators to anchor community-driven initiatives</h1>

<p>Two years have passed since we launched a Canadian survey of Borealis research data repository administrators. The goal of the survey was to identify gaps in the data repository services landscape that might be collaboratively addressed by a national community of research data management librarians, data specialists, data repository managers, and infrastructure providers. This presentation will focus on how results of this survey have helped to steer the launch of new community-driven initiatives.<br /><br />Three primary gaps identified by the survey include capacity or support for developing curation models, preservation planning and workflows, and support for sensitive data deposit in the context of limited staffing capacity. Regarding curation and preservation, we will discuss how the survey results supported the relaunch of a community initiative to update and develop new resources and documentation for Borealis institutional research data repositories seeking to apply for CoreTrustSeal (CTS) certification or to benchmark their services. CTS requirements mandate specific levels of preservation and curation activities that align with gaps identified in our survey results. Borealis-specific resources on how members of our national shared research data repository infrastructure may implement service models to meet CTS requirements also provides guidance on the resources and capacity required for harmonizing curation models to international standards.<br /><br />We will also discuss how the survey results have helped to shape the work of a collaborative group of librarians and data repository administrators aiming to draft guidelines and a checklist for sensitive data deposit as contextually defined by a combination of institutional and national policies, regulations, and frameworks. For example, we will discuss standardizing the guidelines to common levels of risk related to research data. This presentation will also address variations in institutional-level staffing models and how we plan to use a longitudinal survey design to track shifts in readiness and capacity over time.</p>
