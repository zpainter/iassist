<p>This poster session, &quot;Charting New Horizons: Advancing Data Consultation and Visualization at Clemson Library for a Connected Future,&quot; will highlight how Clemson Library has relaunched its data services to better serve its diverse user base. The initiative aimed to refine and expand data consultation and visualization services, making them more accessible, impactful, and effective. This effort was driven by the need to modernize and broaden the scope of the library's previously limited and outdated data services, which could no longer meet the growing demands of users.<br /><br />The project involved a comprehensive redesign and implementation process, which included assessing user needs, launching robust rebranding and marketing campaigns, developing new service models, and hiring a new team of Graduate Assistants to serve as data visualization experts and contribute to the consultation process. Key achievements included increased user engagement, higher patron satisfaction, and a more streamlined data consultation process.<br /><br />Despite challenges such as resource constraints and marketing setbacks, these obstacles were mitigated through collaboration with various University partners. We worked closely with several campus departments to offer engaging workshops on data visualization topics, which were well-attended and received. Additionally, we partnered with the Graduate School, which provided funding in exchange for workshops tailored to graduate students and data services professional development.<br /><br />The revamped services have significantly impacted both the library and its users, as demonstrated by quantitative and qualitative data reflecting enhanced user experiences and greater service utilization.<br /><br />Looking ahead, future plans include expanding the range of services offered, hiring a full-time Data Visualization Specialist, and continuing to innovate in data consultation and visualization. The long-term goal is to establish Clemson Library as a campus leader in data visualization services, fostering a connected and informed community.</p>
