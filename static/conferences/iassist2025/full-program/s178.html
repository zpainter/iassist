AI literacy demands data literacy. This elicits the essential questions of: what does data literacy look like in the AI era? How should I become fluent with data as a researcher, educator, healthcare provider, government employee, citizen, etc. to navigate this new data and information environment?<br /><br />This panel will explore the facets of AI opportunities, challenges and ethical considerations in developing data literacy in the AI age.

We will discuss practical strategies for building data literacy skills at both individual and institutional levels.
