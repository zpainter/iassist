      <description>DataQ is a collaborative platform for the community to use to ask and answer questions related to research data support in academic libraries. Library staff from any institution may submit questions on research data topics to the DataQ website, where questions are reviewed by an Editorial Team of experts with additional support from an active pool of Project Volunteers. Answers to these questions, from both the community and the Editorial Team, are posted to the DataQ website and include links to resources and tools, best practices, and practical approaches to working with researchers to address specific research data issues.</description>

      <description>Thanks to Lynda Kellam at the Dataland Blog for highlighting the United States Department of Housing &amp;amp; Urban Development (HUD) Data Set Reference Guides. HUD has a dense website and posts a lot of data. These two tables help you figure out which ones are most relevant for which areas of research. Unfortunately, neither has a usefully descriptive name or clear pattern of inclusion. The second guide is much shorter and includes sets like the CBO Appropriations and Fair Housing Cases as opposed to the American Housing Survey and State of the Cities listed on the first guide.</description>
