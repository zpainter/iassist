      <description>The Qualitative Social Science and Humanities Data Interest Group (QSSHDIG) had another great year. We would love to have you join us if you are interested in our group. Just ask Mandy or Lynda.
 At IASSIST 2017 we had social gathering and a BoF meeting to brainstorm activities for upcoming year. You can read our notes from the discussion on our website. A subgroup posted afour-part blog series in late July/early August of 2017.</description>

      <description>[Posted on behalf of Kristi Thompson]
The special issue of the International Journal of Librarianship on Data Librarianship I guest edited has been published. One feature in particular that might be of interest to IASSISTers is an article in which we interviewed a number of people who had prominent and interesting careers in the field and asked them to share their thoughts on how data services have changes over the course of their careers, as well as advice for newbies.</description>

      <description>2016-2017 Report on the IASSIST Geospatial Interest Group
The group was founded in the Spring/Summer of 2016 and met at the 2016 Bergen conference. The central purpose of the IASSIST Geospatial Interest Group is to create a network for members focused on issues of geospatial data as related to the social sciences. The current chair is Jennifer Moore (Washington University in St. Louis)
At the meeting in Bergen (review notes) we discussed the merits of an IASSIST geospatial interest group in relation to existing groups (e.</description>

      <description>Late last year, a colleague at Innovations for Poverty Action, Stephanie Wykstra, and I started having conversations about reuse of open data and what we do and don&amp;rsquo;t know about the re-use of existing data sets, particularly which data sets and how they are used. We are also interested in the specific challenges researchers face as they try to re-use data sets collected for other research purposes. Stephanie and I would like to start filling this gap so we are putting out a call for case studies.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to see no less than 7 IQ articles in the latest version. I didn&amp;rsquo;t count IASSISTers who published elsewhere but several of those were in the list as well.

  The major activity of the Data Management &amp;amp; Curation Interest Group (SIGDMC) in the last year was the conceptualization, organization, submission, and offering of the June 2, 2014, morning workshop Data Management &amp;amp; Curation: Lessons from Government, Academia, and Research. It features seven invited presenters, and session and breakout group moderators from the SIGDMC membership, which also provided input on the breakout group topics.</description>

      <description>Freeing African Data Two regional developments have the potential to get African government data into the public domain. Putting their disaggregated data out there can benefit African governance through ensuring transparency and allowing feedback from policy analysis to support better government planning. The World Bank&amp;rsquo;s Central microdata catalog has been around since 2012 and continues to expand its listing of data sources. This is currently the only comprehensive online source for microdata produced by African official data producers, as a listing of country datasets is not available on most African government websites.</description>

      <description>Hey IASSISTers (gents, pardon for the video pun - couldnt&amp;rsquo; resist),
Are librarians at your institutions struggling to get up to speed with research data management (RDM)? If they&amp;rsquo;re not, they probably should be. Library organisations are publishing reports and issuing recommendations left and right, such as the LIBER (Association of European Research Libraries) 2012 report, &amp;ldquo;Ten Recommendations for Libraries to Get Started with Research Data Management&amp;rdquo; (PDF). Just last week Nature published an article highlighting what the Great and the Good are doing in this area: Publishing Frontiers: The Library Reboot.</description>

      <description>Great work by Richard Ball, an Economics professor at Haverford College and Norm Medeiros, a Haverford librarian. I&amp;rsquo;m already planning to incorporate their protocol into my formal and informal data literacy instruction. I highly recommend a visit to their website: Teaching integrity in empirical research: a soup to nuts protocol
They&amp;rsquo;ve also published a paper on their work. Here&amp;rsquo;s the abstract:
 This article describes a protocol the authors developed for teaching undergraduates to document their statistical analyses for empirical research projects so that their results are completely reproducible and verifiable.</description>

      <description>Those members who follow IASST-L may recall that about a month ago I launched an informal poll to find out whether or not your data management plan services include reading and reviewing draft plans. I had a total of 22 respondents with the following results:
Does your data management plan service include reading and reviewing draft plans?
 18% (4) - Yes, as a matter of policy. 36% (8) - Not a policy, but I have reviewed them in the past.</description>

      <description>In 2006, motivated by the OECD Open Access guidelines, the Finnish Social Science Data Archive (FSD) carried out an online survey targeting professors of human sciences, social sciences and behavioural sciences in Finnish universities. Professors were asked, for example, whether their department had any guidelines on the preservation of digital research data. A great and alarming majority (90%) said no. The survey also charted what actually happens to research data and what are the barriers to and benefits of open access to research data.</description>

      <description>As part of the JISC-funded DISC-UK DataShare project{.moz-txt-link-freetext} in the UK, a State-of-the-Art Review has been written, marking out the current scene on data sharing at the beginning of the project. While the report is UK-focused, it may be of wider interest, and has a very thorough bibliography.
DISC-UK is a UK consortium of data support professionals working in departments and academic libraries in universities (Data Information Specialists Committee-United Kingdom). The project is about DISC-UK members (all of whom are also IASSIST members) working with academics and institutional repository managers at the four partner institutions - London School of Economics and the Universities of Edinburgh, Oxford and Southampton - to provide exemplars for sharing research data within institutional repositories (based on EPrints.</description>

      <description>The RIN (Research Information Network) has recently published a draft consultation paper - Stewardship of digital research data: a framework of principles and guidelines (April 2007) and are seeking feedback from practitioners.
The draft discusses the shared framework of principles and guidelines required for key stakeholders (researchers, research institutions, funding bodies, libraries, data managers, learned societies and publishers) in order to maximise the potential benefits of digital research data and to help ensure that &amp;lsquo;ideas and knowledge derived from publicly-funded research should be made available and accessible for public use, interrogation, and scrutiny, as widely, rapidly and effectively as practicable.</description>

      <description>Interesting report applying the Open Archival Information System (OAIS) model and the Metadata Encoding and Transmission Standard (METS) to the UK Data Archive; a very useful convergence of preservation strategies and articulation of what the model means for data and disciplinary focused digital repositories/archives.Email from the Digital Preservation Department at the UK National Archives:
 In conjunction with the UK Data Archive, The National Archives have released a report comparing their preservation practices to the leading internationally recognised standard for digital archives.</description>

      <description>The final report of the Canadian National Consultation on Access to Scientific Research Data has just been released containing eighteen recommendations to improve open access to research data in Canada. While some of these recommendations are unique to the Canadian context, others share a close relationship with the recommendations of the International Council for Science report, Scientific Data and Information. Supported by the National Research Council of Canada, a task force was established in June 2004 to provide advice about improving access to scientific research data.</description>
