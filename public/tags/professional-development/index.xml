In February I won sponsorship money from IASSIST for a Data Workshop I had in mind. On the 18 November this year I saw my idea come to life. This Data Workshop was aimed at Library student and newgrads and was held in the Ferguson Room of the National Library of Australia. 26 people attended and there were five speakers from industries adjacent to librarianship.</description>

Norwood, former US Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, dies On the passing of this iconic defender of the neutrality of public data, I am struck how important Janet Norwood was to establishing a sound path for data advocacy as well as reminded of how necessary it is to have continuous education about this topic. In fact, swimming in ready-access to data as we are today, it&amp;rsquo;s especially important that we, as data professionals, remain alert to and defend a couple of aphorisms:</description>

      <description>Hey IASSISTers (gents, pardon for the video pun - couldnt&amp;rsquo; resist),
Are librarians at your institutions struggling to get up to speed with research data management (RDM)? If they&amp;rsquo;re not, they probably should be. Library organisations are publishing reports and issuing recommendations left and right, such as the LIBER (Association of European Research Libraries) 2012 report, &amp;ldquo;Ten Recommendations for Libraries to Get Started with Research Data Management&amp;rdquo; (PDF). Just last week Nature published an article highlighting what the Great and the Good are doing in this area: Publishing Frontiers: The Library Reboot.</description>

 With the upcoming 2013 Conference nearing, we thought it very fitting to introduce you all to the newly created IASSIST Data Visualization Interest Group. Formed over the winter and now spring of 2013, this group brings together over 46 IASSIST members from across the world (literally across-the-world! check out the map of our locations), who are all interested in data visualization. We hope to share a range of skills and information around tools, best practice visualization, and discuss innovative representations of data, statistics, and information.</description>

Workshop at eResearch Australasia 2011
Thursday 10 November 2011: 9:00-12:30
http://conference.eresearch.edu.au/workshops/#8
The Australian National Data Service (ANDS) is currently developing a service called &amp;ldquo;Cite My Data&amp;rdquo; [1], which uses the international DataCite infrastructure [2] to support the citation of Australian research sector datasets. The DataCite infrastructure is built on the Digital Object Identifier (DOI) system [3]&amp;ndash;widely used for citation and tracking of scholarly publications.</description>

The images on some of the posters are really powerful&amp;hellip;.</description>

[http://iassistdata.org/iq/issue/33/3]
With this issue concentrating on quantitative investigations and the use of statistics, I came to think of the Mark Twain citation &amp;ldquo;There are three kinds of lies: lies, damned lies, and statistics.&amp;rdquo; With the violent title of the first article (see below), the article on numbers and statistics, and the report from a national statistics agency, the &amp;ldquo;Torture,Numbers, and Digital Tape&amp;rdquo; title surfaced.</description>

      <description>After our annual conferences, members often want to continue conversations with IASSIST colleagues on topics of professional interest. Your Administrative Committee has responded by creating the Interest Group Development Action Group. Its charge is to identify and help form interest groups so members can continue those conversations.
An interest group is a great way to share information on a topic of mutual interest, learn more about it, and share that knowledge with the larger IASSIST membership.</description>

      <description>Announcement of Workshop: Providing Social Science Data Services: Strategies for Design and Operation http://www.icpsr.umich.edu/icpsrweb/sumprog/courses/0041 August 9-13, 2010 Ann Arbor Michigan
Instructors: Chuck Humphrey, Head of the Data Library, University of Alberta Jim Jacobs, Data Services Librarian Emeritus, University of California San Diego
This five-day workshop is being offered for individuals who manage or provide local support services for ICPSR and other numeric data for quantitative research.
Providing access to data has taken on greater prominence over this past decade with the emergence of several significant developments, including, e-Science infrastructure funding, the open data movement, national and institutional digital preservation strategies &amp;amp; services, data enclaves for confidential data, lifecycle data management planning, and data mash-up technologies on the Internet.</description>

      <description>A week has passed since IASSIST 2009. I hope most of you have made it safely back home by now - and are ready to refresh the memories by watching the conference webcasts and viewing presentations. Webcasts of all three plenaries and Thursday and Friday&amp;rsquo;s concurrent sessions in the Small Auditorium are now available. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have cameras available during the Wednesday sessions, so no videos of these presentations, sorry! But most of the presentations are already online - a few are still missing either because we didn&amp;rsquo;t have them or we are waiting for an updated version.</description>

It is a good example of data availability (&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about this because I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to investigate a perceived crime wave in my home town.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Do you keep news stories that mis-state, misinterpret or otherwise misuse numeric data? I have a faculty member who would like to use such examples to demonstrate to her students the importance of numeracy in real life. I have a few examples but suspect others of you may stash this kind of thing in a &amp;ldquo;Can you believe this?</description>

      <description>The RIN (Research Information Network) has recently published a draft consultation paper - Stewardship of digital research data: a framework of principles and guidelines (April 2007) and are seeking feedback from practitioners.
The draft discusses the shared framework of principles and guidelines required for key stakeholders (researchers, research institutions, funding bodies, libraries, data managers, learned societies and publishers) in order to maximise the potential benefits of digital research data and to help ensure that &amp;lsquo;ideas and knowledge derived from publicly-funded research should be made available and accessible for public use, interrogation, and scrutiny, as widely, rapidly and effectively as practicable.</description>

      <description>In their never ending quest for information, Jen, Tiffani and Paula would like to know about people&amp;rsquo;s experiences cataloging data. Do you use MARC format? Have you tried using DDI? At what level do you tend to catalog collections? How does it depart from cataloging traditional library matter? Enquiring minds want to know.

In addition, some of the sources they consulted (the Online Dictionary of Library and Information Science - ODLIS , Oxford English Dictionary ) were not adequate (ODLIS has data, data set, social science data set but the definitions are not that great).</description>
