      <description>Sung to the tune of Gordon Lightfoot&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;If You Could Read My Mind&amp;rdquo;; thanks to San, Paula, Bill, and Vince for their suggestions, and Vince, Dan and Kate for helping to drown out my own voice :) If anyone has a video version of this, send me the link, so I can add it here:
If you could read my data What a tale these points would tell At Toronto&amp;rsquo;s IASSIST 40 Data folk began to dwell At the hockey game We began to meet With colleagues and old friends These meetings never end Aligning data with infrastructure of research is what it&amp;rsquo;s all about</description>

      <description>Lots of conversations going on these days in different venues where people are asking many of the same questions: how do we teach researchers about data management with limited staff, and what data management services should we offer? How do we find sustainable ways to manage data that leverage the efforts of many different repositories, those in government, institutions and disciplinary ones? How do we coalesce standard practice and reasonable but effective policies at at least the national level and preferably on a global scale?</description>

      <description>Freeing African Data Two regional developments have the potential to get African government data into the public domain. Putting their disaggregated data out there can benefit African governance through ensuring transparency and allowing feedback from policy analysis to support better government planning. The World Bank&amp;rsquo;s Central microdata catalog has been around since 2012 and continues to expand its listing of data sources. This is currently the only comprehensive online source for microdata produced by African official data producers, as a listing of country datasets is not available on most African government websites.</description>
