      <description>Welcome to the second issue of Volume 40 of the IASSIST Quarterly (IQ 40:2, 2016). We present three papers in this issue.
http://iassistdata.org/iq/issue/40/2
First, there are two papers on the Data Documentation Initiative that have their own special introduction. I want to express my respect and gratitude to Joachim Wackerow (GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences). Joachim (Achim) and Mary Vardigan (University of Michigan) have several times and for many years communicated to and advised the readers of the IASSIST Quarterly on the continuing development of the DDI.</description>

      <description>The International Digital Curation Conference (IDCC) is now ten years old. On the evidence of its most recent conference, is in rude health and growing fast.
IDCC is the first time IASSIST decided to formally support another organisational conference. I think it was a wise investment given the quality of plenaries, presentations, posters, and discussions.
DCC already has available a number of blogs covering the substance of sessions, including an excellent summary by IASSIST web editor, Robin Rice.</description>

I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to see no less than 7 IQ articles in the latest version. I didn&amp;rsquo;t count IASSISTers who published elsewhere but several of those were in the list as well.

      <description>Lots of conversations going on these days in different venues where people are asking many of the same questions: how do we teach researchers about data management with limited staff, and what data management services should we offer? How do we find sustainable ways to manage data that leverage the efforts of many different repositories, those in government, institutions and disciplinary ones? How do we coalesce standard practice and reasonable but effective policies at at least the national level and preferably on a global scale?</description>

      <description>Some reflections on research data confidentiality, privacy, and curation
Limor Peer
Maintaining research subjects&amp;rsquo; confidentiality is an essential feature of the scientific research enterprise. It also presents special challenges to the data curation process. Does the effort to open access to research data complicate these challenges?
A few reasons why I think it does: More data are discoverable and could be used to re-identify previously de-identified datasets; systems are increasingly interoperable, potentially bridging what may have been insular academic data with other data and information sources; growing pressure to open data may weaken some of the safeguards previously put in place; and some data are inherently identifiable.</description>

 http://iassistdata.org/iq/issue/34/2
The layout has changed. We hope you&amp;rsquo;ll enjoy the new style presented. It seems to be a more modern format and more suited for the PDF presentation on the web. Walter Piovesan &amp;ndash; our publication officer &amp;ndash; had a biking accident. To show that nothing is so bad that it is not good for something Walter used his recovery time to redesign the IQ.</description>

      <description>A week has passed since IASSIST 2009. I hope most of you have made it safely back home by now - and are ready to refresh the memories by watching the conference webcasts and viewing presentations. Webcasts of all three plenaries and Thursday and Friday&amp;rsquo;s concurrent sessions in the Small Auditorium are now available. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have cameras available during the Wednesday sessions, so no videos of these presentations, sorry! But most of the presentations are already online - a few are still missing either because we didn&amp;rsquo;t have them or we are waiting for an updated version.</description>

      <description>In 2006, motivated by the OECD Open Access guidelines, the Finnish Social Science Data Archive (FSD) carried out an online survey targeting professors of human sciences, social sciences and behavioural sciences in Finnish universities. Professors were asked, for example, whether their department had any guidelines on the preservation of digital research data. A great and alarming majority (90%) said no. The survey also charted what actually happens to research data and what are the barriers to and benefits of open access to research data.</description>

The research process generates huge amounts of data that are an important part of Canada&amp;rsquo;s scholarly record and hold enormous potential as an additional discovery and problem-solving tool for researchers. Unfortunately, Canada has no nationally adopted standards or policies governing how this data is collected, catalogued, or preserved.

I allocated too few moments to visiting the poster sessions. One that intrigued me was the Digital Library Federation&amp;rsquo;s American Social History Online project, or Aquifer. (Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s the fact that I was a history major.</description>

      <description>As part of the JISC-funded DISC-UK DataShare project{.moz-txt-link-freetext} in the UK, a State-of-the-Art Review has been written, marking out the current scene on data sharing at the beginning of the project. While the report is UK-focused, it may be of wider interest, and has a very thorough bibliography.
DISC-UK is a UK consortium of data support professionals working in departments and academic libraries in universities (Data Information Specialists Committee-United Kingdom). The project is about DISC-UK members (all of whom are also IASSIST members) working with academics and institutional repository managers at the four partner institutions - London School of Economics and the Universities of Edinburgh, Oxford and Southampton - to provide exemplars for sharing research data within institutional repositories (based on EPrints.</description>

      <description>The May 21 issue of Boing Boing describes the InfoBunker, a &amp;ldquo;Cold War era government command bunker converted into a data center&amp;rdquo;. I realize that they&amp;rsquo;re not referring to the same kind of data center we mean, but it was kind of fun to read about a data center that has &amp;ldquo;a self-sufficient power systems (six days&amp;rsquo; worth of diesel fuel; 17,000 gallons of water (for drinking and fire suppression); military-grade NBC air filtration).</description>

      <description>The RIN (Research Information Network) has recently published a draft consultation paper - Stewardship of digital research data: a framework of principles and guidelines (April 2007) and are seeking feedback from practitioners.
The draft discusses the shared framework of principles and guidelines required for key stakeholders (researchers, research institutions, funding bodies, libraries, data managers, learned societies and publishers) in order to maximise the potential benefits of digital research data and to help ensure that &amp;lsquo;ideas and knowledge derived from publicly-funded research should be made available and accessible for public use, interrogation, and scrutiny, as widely, rapidly and effectively as practicable.</description>

      <description>Recently I posted a message to the IASSIST mailing list about a study in in the ICPSR Publication Related Archive that had a data file in an old (SST) statistical software format. I had no tools to convert or even read that file and was looking for a solution to get the data. I solved that problem through the kindness of the software producer who converted the file for me.</description>

      <description>The final report of the Canadian National Consultation on Access to Scientific Research Data has just been released containing eighteen recommendations to improve open access to research data in Canada. While some of these recommendations are unique to the Canadian context, others share a close relationship with the recommendations of the International Council for Science report, Scientific Data and Information. Supported by the National Research Council of Canada, a task force was established in June 2004 to provide advice about improving access to scientific research data.</description>

      <description>Two sessions at the Edinburgh conference helped formulate in my mind some concerns that I have about the future of data archives. Together, the plenary session in which John Curtice described his research about postmodern values and Session G3 on Transforming Data Archives unified for me (i) ideas about anti-institutional values expressed in postmodernism and (ii) current organizational threats to data archives.
I have been troubled by the struggles we have confronted in Canada to establish a national institution to preserve data.</description>
