      <description>Spring 2017
Mongolia is large and sparsely populated country, with nomadic traditions, but rapidly modernizing. As in any modern country, there is an important role for data to play in planning and development, and Mongolian data professionals are developing themselves to meet the challenge.
Last year in May 2017, Ryan Womack (currently serving as IASSIST Secretary) was invited to give a two-day workshop on **Topics in Data Science **at the National Statistics Office of Mongolia.</description>

      <description>Last week Mandy shared ideas about how librarians and other data-support professionals can act as connectors, crusaders and collaborators on campus in order to better provide and develop qualitative research teaching resources. This week we want to build on Mandy&amp;rsquo;s suggestions by looking a bit more broadly at how librarians and other data-support professionals can help build community around qualitative research at their institutions.
As qualitative research methods are often not the dominant methodologies used in departments and institutions, qualitative researchers may not have a strong support network and may lack colleagues to consult with or learn from.</description>

      <description>Connectors, Crusaders, and Collaborators Jill&amp;rsquo;s post from last week detailed ways we data-support professionals can connect researchers to library collections and other information sources for bridging the qualitative methods gap. I&amp;rsquo;d like to offer more ideas for how we can act not only as connectors but also as crusaders and collaborators on our campuses specifically in the realm of providing and developing qualitative-research teaching resources. Because we work with researchers across campus and in various capacities, data-support professionals are often more aware of methods gaps than are the academic departments we support.</description>

The special issue of the International Journal of Librarianship on Data Librarianship I guest edited has been published. One feature in particular that might be of interest to IASSISTers is an article in which we interviewed a number of people who had prominent and interesting careers in the field and asked them to share their thoughts on how data services have changes over the course of their careers, as well as advice for newbies.</description>

      <description>Mandy kicked off our 4-part blog series last week with an inaugural post that provided background and context for this project, which centers around a specific challenge faced by many qualitative researchers: lack of qualitative methods training. This post offers some concrete ideas to data-support professionals on how to leverage library collections and other information sources that direct researchers to secondary and tertiary sources on qualitative methods to address this issue.</description>

      <description>The IASSIST Qualitative Social Science &amp;amp; Humanities Data Interest Group (QSSHDIG) was created in October 2016, its central purpose: to foster conversations regarding the needs of researchers who generate qualitative data, and what types of services librarians and other information professionals can develop to support these researchers in managing their data/source materials throughout the research lifecycle.
This four-post blog series engages in one particular conversation: challenges researchers face in terms of a lack of qualitative methods training, and strategies for how data-support professionals can address these challenges.</description>

      <description>For the third time IASSIST sponsored the International Digital Curation Conference. This time allowing three students, one each from Switzerland, Korea, and Canada to attend the conference, which titled itself &amp;ldquo;Upstream, Downstream: embedding digital curation workflows for data science, scholarship and society&amp;rdquo;.
Data science was a strong theme of the three keynote presentations, in particular how curation and data management are an active, integrated, ongoing parts of analysis rather than a passive epilogue in research.</description>

      <description>Jisc held their second Research Data Network event in Cambridge. I went along to take notes.
Danny Kingsley gave an overview of why data sharing is important, which was useful as introduction for those new to this, and a refresher of first principles to the more experienced.
The day then moved into parallel sessions on aspects of the network&amp;rsquo;s activity.
The Research Data Shared Service is an initiative to help intuitions with RDM infrastructure.</description>

      <description>Janet L. Norwood, former US Bureau of Labor Statistics commissioner, dies On the passing of this iconic defender of the neutrality of public data, I am struck how important Janet Norwood was to establishing a sound path for data advocacy as well as reminded of how necessary it is to have continuous education about this topic. In fact, swimming in ready-access to data as we are today, it&amp;rsquo;s especially important that we, as data professionals, remain alert to and defend a couple of aphorisms:</description>

      <description>The International Digital Curation Conference (IDCC) is now ten years old. On the evidence of its most recent conference, is in rude health and growing fast.
IDCC is the first time IASSIST decided to formally support another organisational conference. I think it was a wise investment given the quality of plenaries, presentations, posters, and discussions.
DCC already has available a number of blogs covering the substance of sessions, including an excellent summary by IASSIST web editor, Robin Rice.</description>

      <description>A few days ago I asked on the IASSIST mailing list for some help in order to find out dates of creation of data libraries, data centres and such services. It was overwhelming to receive answers from colleagues from everywhere with dates and some other useful information about the establishment of local data support and national services.

      <description>Lots of conversations going on these days in different venues where people are asking many of the same questions: how do we teach researchers about data management with limited staff, and what data management services should we offer? How do we find sustainable ways to manage data that leverage the efforts of many different repositories, those in government, institutions and disciplinary ones? How do we coalesce standard practice and reasonable but effective policies at at least the national level and preferably on a global scale?</description>

      <description>Freeing African Data Two regional developments have the potential to get African government data into the public domain. Putting their disaggregated data out there can benefit African governance through ensuring transparency and allowing feedback from policy analysis to support better government planning. The World Bank&amp;rsquo;s Central microdata catalog has been around since 2012 and continues to expand its listing of data sources. This is currently the only comprehensive online source for microdata produced by African official data producers, as a listing of country datasets is not available on most African government websites.</description>

No surprises: we define ourselves as data people or organisations, in terms of &amp;ldquo;research&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;librarian&amp;rdquo; (and library related terms), &amp;ldquo;social&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;science&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;digital&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;information&amp;rdquo;, and &amp;ldquo;universities&amp;rdquo;.</description>

These questions were on my mind as I was preparing to present a poster at the Open Repositories 2013 conference in Charlottetown, PEI earlier this month. The annual conference brings the digital repositories community together with stakeholders, such as researchers, librarians, publishers and others to address issues pertaining to &amp;ldquo;the entire lifecycle of information.&amp;rdquo; The conference theme this year, &amp;ldquo;Use, Reuse, Reproduce,&amp;rdquo; could not have been more relevant to the ISPS Data Archive.</description>

      <description>Open Repositories 2013 was hosted by the University of Prince Edward Island from July 8-12. A strong research data stream ran throughout this conference, which was attended by over 300 participants from around the globe. To my delight, many IASSISTers were in attendance, including the current IASSIST President and four Past-Presidents! Rarely do such sightings happen outside an IASSIST conference.
  IASSIST Five Presidents by Limor Peer   This was my first Open Repositories conference and after the cool reception that research data received at the SPARC IR meetings in Baltimore a few years ago, I was unsure how data would be treated at this conference.</description>

      <description>Hey IASSISTers (gents, pardon for the video pun - couldnt&amp;rsquo; resist),
Are librarians at your institutions struggling to get up to speed with research data management (RDM)? If they&amp;rsquo;re not, they probably should be. Library organisations are publishing reports and issuing recommendations left and right, such as the LIBER (Association of European Research Libraries) 2012 report, &amp;ldquo;Ten Recommendations for Libraries to Get Started with Research Data Management&amp;rdquo; (PDF). Just last week Nature published an article highlighting what the Great and the Good are doing in this area: Publishing Frontiers: The Library Reboot.</description>

      <description>These days many IASSIST members have received acceptance for their papers to the upcoming conference IASSIST 2013 in Cologne. There will be many interesting presentations at the conference. The conference presentation is your chance to present a project you are involved in, to air your argumentation for special areas, and in general to add to the IASSIST knowledge bank.
Projects are typically focused on support of social science research but the IASSIST related support now takes many forms with the developments of technology and applications.</description>

      <description>Some reflections on research data confidentiality, privacy, and curation
Limor Peer
Maintaining research subjects&amp;rsquo; confidentiality is an essential feature of the scientific research enterprise. It also presents special challenges to the data curation process. Does the effort to open access to research data complicate these challenges?
A few reasons why I think it does: More data are discoverable and could be used to re-identify previously de-identified datasets; systems are increasingly interoperable, potentially bridging what may have been insular academic data with other data and information sources; growing pressure to open data may weaken some of the safeguards previously put in place; and some data are inherently identifiable.</description>

      <description>I was lucky enough to be able to sit in on the most recent COPAFS meeting in place of our regular liaison Judith Rowe. While the topics were very different than the issues I usually deal with at work, I found the presentations really interesting. Here&amp;rsquo;s an abridged version of my notes.

      <description>The IASSIST Special Interest Group on Data Citation (SIGDC) met in Vancouver on Wednesday, June 1, with 15 people in attendance. The group discussed ways in which IASSIST members could influence data citation standards and behavior. Suggestions were made to:
 Inventory the resources that the SIG maintains and knows about Create a set of simple slides to share with faculty and students; these might include guidelines on citation format with examples but would not endorse a certain format Create posters on data citation to hang in prominent places Contact bibliographic software companies to make sure they include data as a specific resource type Contact style guides &amp;ndash; APA, Chicago, MLA &amp;ndash; to ensure that they are providing appropriate citations for data and including DOIs Create a set of Web pages on this topic on the IASSIST site Contact Google Scholar with a list of issues related to data  Joachim Wackerow presented information on ways to make DOIs more machine-actionable.</description>

It isn&amp;rsquo;t every day that an incoming university president envies data over basketball! Congratulations to our colleagues at the Roper Center for this well deserved recognition.
Susan Herbst, incoming President at the University of Connecticut: What about UConn drew you here?
&amp;ldquo;There are many aspects of UConn that attracted me, but the primary one is the spirit of the institution. Growing up in the Northeast, I knew many people who attended UConn and held a deep, abiding love of the University.</description>

      <description>After our annual conferences, members often want to continue conversations with IASSIST colleagues on topics of professional interest. Your Administrative Committee has responded by creating the Interest Group Development Action Group. Its charge is to identify and help form interest groups so members can continue those conversations.
An interest group is a great way to share information on a topic of mutual interest, learn more about it, and share that knowledge with the larger IASSIST membership.</description>

Webcasts of all three plenaries and Thursday and Friday&amp;rsquo;s concurrent sessions in the Small Auditorium are now available. We didn&amp;rsquo;t have cameras available during the Wednesday sessions, so no videos of these presentations, sorry! But most of the presentations are already online - a few are still missing either because we didn&amp;rsquo;t have them or we are waiting for an updated version.</description>

On 5 December 2008, following on from the Digital Curation Centre international conference held in Edinburgh that week, friends and colleagues from near and far gathered in the afternoon at the EDINA offices to celebrate the milestone with short speeches and cutting the cake, along with food, drink and toasts.</description>

      <description>And another conference has passed. It&amp;rsquo;s so sad to think that it will be another year before we get together again but at least we can play virtually on our lists, this blog and maybe even in SecondLife! I&amp;rsquo;m still trying to round up more conference reports but in the meantime, here&amp;rsquo;s the official conference song lyrics. Sing to the tune of The Band&amp;rsquo;s song &amp;ldquo;The Weight&amp;rdquo;
In case the tune doesn&amp;rsquo;t come to mind immediately, here&amp;rsquo;s a clip on YouTube from the movie &amp;ldquo;The Last Waltz&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>So I had the best intentions to blog the conference but alas I was distracted - creating my SecondLife avatar to be able to participate virtually as well as in reality was far more interesting than I want to admit! My teenagers were appalled when they found out I was on Facebook
 what will they say when I tell them about SusieQue!  [](http://iassistblog.org/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/iassistsl_small.wmf) As a technology-oriented association hosting a technology-themed conference, it is maybe not surprising that we should experiment a bit.</description>

      <description>First, on January 18th, an announcement was made on blog.wired.comthat Google will be hosting terabytes of science data.
 Sources at Google have disclosed that the humble domain, http://research.google.com , will soon provide a home for terabytes of open-source scientific datasets. The storage will be free to scientists and access to the data will be free for all. The project, known as Palimpsest and first previewed to the scientific community at the Science Foo camp at the Googleplex last August, missed its original launch date this week, but will debut soon.</description>

      <description>For those tech-types who do their own data munging, here&amp;rsquo;s a rant from Mark Dominus, a Perl programming wizard who was briefly stymied by trying to process a large data file from Census. As we face these issues daily in my office, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d share the frustration!
Of course, he doesn&amp;rsquo;t mention where he thinks metadata &amp;ldquo;should&amp;rdquo; go but I have a pretty good idea what he would suggest&amp;hellip;. ;-)</description>

The Pullman House History Project is a part of the Pullman State Historic Site&amp;rsquo;s virtual museum and web site (http://www.pullman-museum.org/) which links together census, city directory, and telephone directory information to describe the people who lived in the town of Pullman, Illinois between 1881 and 1940. This demographic data is linked through a database/XML record system to online maps and Perl programs that allow the data to be represented in various useful combinations.</description>

      <description>Jim sent me a message earlier today about a new data visualisation website that he had discovered: StatCrunch. When I took a look at this site, I encountered an appeal for people to upload and share their data, which struck a familiar chord. It seems that all of these web-based visualisation tools make a similar appeal. This certainly is true of Swivel, Data360 and Many Eyes.
Thinking back to an earlier era, statistical package vendors always included some data with their software.</description>

      <description>As part of the JISC-funded DISC-UK DataShare project{.moz-txt-link-freetext} in the UK, a State-of-the-Art Review has been written, marking out the current scene on data sharing at the beginning of the project. While the report is UK-focused, it may be of wider interest, and has a very thorough bibliography.
DISC-UK is a UK consortium of data support professionals working in departments and academic libraries in universities (Data Information Specialists Committee-United Kingdom). The project is about DISC-UK members (all of whom are also IASSIST members) working with academics and institutional repository managers at the four partner institutions - London School of Economics and the Universities of Edinburgh, Oxford and Southampton - to provide exemplars for sharing research data within institutional repositories (based on EPrints.</description>

In Canada, census releases are no dreary catalogue of numbers. They spark debate and fuel conversation about the country. Statistics Canada has released the results of the 2006 census on marital status, families and housing, and we&amp;rsquo;re at it again. So important is the census that we debate not only its findings, but also access to its content.</description>

I found the screencast, Crime in New Hampshire: Exploring the data, interesting for several reasons:
It is a good example of data availability (&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking about this because I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to investigate a perceived crime wave in my home town.</description>

&amp;ldquo;Do you keep news stories that mis-state, misinterpret or otherwise misuse numeric data? I have a faculty member who would like to use such examples to demonstrate to her students the importance of numeracy in real life. I have a few examples but suspect others of you may stash this kind of thing in a &amp;ldquo;Can you believe this?</description>

Winter came late in Denmark, but suddenly the situation was normal: snow came and traffic stopped. And now 14 days after spring was here in March. I sat outside in the sun reading articles. Still it&amp;rsquo;s more difficult to write articles outside, we are waiting for the improvements of the computer screens. However, some people have stayed inside to write articles for the IASSIST Quarterly.</description>

This year&amp;rsquo;s conference is done and Anastassia, Susan, and the wonderful Local arrangement folks at McGill are probably breathing a sigh of relief!

More will likely be reviewed over coming weeks preceded by the usual &amp;ldquo;Now I know I saw a presentation about this at IASSIST&amp;hellip;.&amp;rdquo;
If you were one of those fine presenters, please don&amp;rsquo;t forget to submit a paper to the IQ (instructions for doing so are on the IASSIST website).</description>

Thank heavens the session was moved to a neighboring room&amp;mdash;larger and with a microphone. Obviously, a popular session on the challenges of working with data agreements from the perspectives of acquisition and user support.</description>

I want to extend my congratulations and kudos to my fellow session participants in C3 (New Discovery Tools: Thinking Outside the Catalogue) where we managed to kill 3 laptops and still do 4 outstanding presentations. The room was too hot and too crowded but the attendees were patient, enthusiastic and even provided some tech support!!
Paul Bern was the lucky presenter - the laptop didn&amp;rsquo;t reallly crash until he was done explaining how to make Google work better for us and help us to help other folks find data.</description>

      <description>An overriding theme of the A1 session, Self-Archiving or Self Storage, was empowering data producers to participate in creating and providing metadata for their materials. Another way to describe it: involving researchers in these processes by meeting them where they&amp;rsquo;re at with the most flexible tools possible. I must also mention that this was an extremely popular session, drawing a standing-room-only crowd. So this roving blogger found a comfy seat in the back of the room on the floor, next to the fake potted palm.</description>

      <description>The conference is on and I&amp;rsquo;m hoping to see lots of blog entries from the interesting sessions today. I&amp;rsquo;m expecting some details on session A1 from another contributor but&amp;hellip;. I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked by Kristin Partlo to pass along the proposals she and Rachael Barlow outlined at the end of their presentation for further comment. So here they are!

      <description>Bill Hooker has written a nice article about ensuring that the data behind published scientific literature are made openly available.
Where are the data? Can I have them? What can I do with them? (17 Dec, 2006).
He takes a practical approach based on the perspective of a researcher. His title says it all.
 &amp;hellip;an Open Data addendum must at least answer my opening questions: it must point to the online, freely accessible location of the raw, un-hamburgered data; it should make clear that yes, you can have them; and it should state clearly what you can do with them.</description>

      <description>The conference theme for IASSIST 2007, Building Global Knowledge Communities with Open Data, is very timely given new interest in defining and describing the open data concept. This week Peter Murray-Rust, who spearheads the SPARC-Opendata discussion list, posted a message announcing his entry for Open Data in the Wikipedia and inviting others to contribute to this entry.
Robin Rice responded to Peter&amp;rsquo;s message with a copy of the IASSIST call for papers, which resulted in the following obervation from Peter: &amp;ldquo;Many of [the topics in the call for papers] have a close overlap with the topics at the Science Commons meeting and it is clear that Open Data is likely to become more widely used.</description>

      <description>Google has announced a new service, that might make it possible for the data community to collaborate to build a customized data-finder. The service is the Google Custom Search Engine (CSE).
Similar in some ways to Rollyo, a service that has been around for some time, the Google CSE has several nice features:
 Limit results of a Google search to specific sites. Exclude sites from search results. Collaborate on the selection of the sites to search and exclude Customize the search results page Add &amp;ldquo;refinements&amp;rdquo; that make it easy for users to refine search results Eliminate Google ads if hosted by a university, government agency, or non-profit  There is a story about the service on eWeek: Google Copies Rollyo&amp;rsquo;s Business Plan, Inserts AdSense (October 24, 2006 4:01 AM) by Steve Bryant.</description>

      <description>Luis Martinez, IASSIST member and Data Librarian at the London School of Economics, has begun an entry on Wikipedia on the topic &amp;ldquo;Data Library&amp;rdquo;. Luis welcomes this community&amp;rsquo;s help in fleshing it out and providing more context. For those who have never been involved with Wikipedia, the editors come round and add comments, and often seem to judge the importance of an entry based on the number of people involved with &amp;lsquo;curating&amp;rsquo; it.</description>

      <description>In their never ending quest for information, Jen, Tiffani and Paula would like to know about people&amp;rsquo;s experiences cataloging data. Do you use MARC format? Have you tried using DDI? At what level do you tend to catalog collections? How does it depart from cataloging traditional library matter? Enquiring minds want to know.

      <description>Tiffani Conner, Paula Lackie and Jen Darragh are working on the handouts for an ALA poster session and have found that defining &amp;ldquo;data&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;data librarian&amp;rdquo; clearly, in a concise manner, for a non-data audience is really hard. In addition, some of the sources they consulted (the Online Dictionary of Library and Information Science - ODLIS , Oxford English Dictionary ) were not adequate (ODLIS has data, data set, social science data set but the definitions are not that great).</description>

      <description>Welcome to the 2006 IASSIST Conference in Ann Arbor! For those who can&amp;rsquo;t join in the fun, we (the Pubs committee and the Admin Committee) have decided it&amp;rsquo;s a good idea for us to blog the conference! (See San&amp;rsquo;s fine example below.) Use this post to comment with your thoughts on a session that really got you thinking. And, (IASSIST members only): become an editor if you would like to post more frequently - contact San.</description>

      <description>I will start with a disclaimer that I am not a metadata expert nor do I play one on TV but I have been spending a lot of time recently contemplating metadata issues. Granted they have been issues that deal with metadata in a time series world but it gave me an interesting frame of reference for attending several sessions on metadata-related issues. Here&amp;rsquo;s my thoughts:
After attending three and a half session exploring metadata issues, the one clear idea that has emerged is that there don&amp;rsquo;t seem to be any clear ideas.</description>

      <description>The ESRC Social Science Week was celebrated from June 20-24, 2005 in the UK. As part of the event, several specialists were invited to write articles about how the Internet has changed the ways in which research is done in the social sciences.
Three IASSIST members were the contributing authors on Wednesday, June 22nd, which had a focus on access to data. Alastair Allan wrote about e-government information and its challenges; Robin Rice addressed issues of access and the uses of open access publishing and digital repositories; and Melanie Wright described the many changes in delivering data using the Internet and this impact on data services.</description>
