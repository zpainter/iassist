      <description>Ann Green completed her second term as President of IASSIST during the conference in Edinburgh.
A long-standing member of IASSIST, Ann served as Vice-President from 1997 to 2001 before serving as President from 2001 to 2005. She has been a excellent leader achieving many accomplishments during her tenure. She brought in a new strategic planning process into 2003, which resulted in a Strategic Plan released in May 2004. This Plan is now being integrated into the directions of our Standing Committees and Action Groups.</description>
