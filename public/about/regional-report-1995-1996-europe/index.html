<dt><strong>Introduction</strong></dt>
<dd>The year has been a very busy and prosperous one for European data
and technology initiatives. Some of these are described below. I
apologise if the balance information seems to be largely with
Ireland, Israel, and the United Kingdom. My appeal over the IASSIST
listserv for information from non-UK countries was answered only by
Ken Hannigan on behalf of Ireland and Michal Peleg for Israel.
Please keep me informed of developments that you know about in other
European areas and I will attempt to give them publicity in future
versions of this annual report.</dd>

<dt><strong>Country reports</strong></dt>
<dd><strong>Cross-national</strong></dd>
<dd>The Danish Data Archive, the Norwegian Social Science Data Service
and the Data Archive at the University of Essex, UK, have benefitted
from funding from the Commission of the European Communities under
the Information Engineering Section of the Telematics Programme to
develop internet services of value to the European data archives and
their users. This project will be known as the NESSTAR (Networked
Social Science Tools and Resources) project.</dd>
<dd>The CESSDA (Council for European Social Science Data Archives) held
a successful Expert Seminar at the University of Essex in November.
As a result of this and earlier meetings great progress has been
made in the integration of European data archives&rsquo; catalogues and
and the provision of easily navigated Web pages.</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>Ireland</strong></p>
<p>I am grateful to Ken Hannigan for the following information.</p>
<p>A Social Science Research Council has been established, one of whose
priorites is the development of data archives. In December, the Council
held a very successful joint forum with the Royal Irish Academy and the
National Archives of Ireland on the subject of data archives, electronic
records and freedom of information. It attracted almost one hundred
participants from a wide spectrum of interests including archives,
libraries and the social sciences. The proceedings will shortly be
available.</p>
<p>Mark Conrad of the US National Archives has spent the current academic
year as a Fulbright scholar in the Archives Department at University
College, Dublin. Mark has also been teaching a course leading to a
Diploma in Archival Studies as well as teaching an in-service course on
electronic records for working archivists. He has been involved in a
wide variety of further activities which have brought forward the issue
of electronic records on several agendas.</p>
<p>Finally, Ken writes: In the course of a debate in the upper house of the
Irish Parliament on the tabling of the first four report os the National
Archives Advisory Council ôseveral senators made reference to the urgent
need for action on electronic records. This was the first occasion on
which electronic archive have been mentioned in Parliament. A small step
for man, but in terms of consciousness-raising in these parts, it might
be seen as a giant leap for mankind.</p>
<p><strong>Israel</strong></p>
<p>Michal Peleg has sent in the following report:</p>
<p>GEOBASE: Supported by the National Planning Authority in the Ministry of
Interior Affairs,the Archive has recently developed and now runs a
multi-dimensional database of Israel regional statistics (geobase).
GEOBASE is managed as Data Warehouse, the contents of which is extracted
from various sources: from the Central Bureau of Statistics, from local
authorities databases, from public services firms and summaries derived
from individual level datasets.</p>
<p>Geobase now contains some 900 data series of population, labor force,
incomes, transportation, construction, tourism, schools and economic
activities- each series refers to all units in one or more geographic
levels.</p>
<p>Future plans include further geographic granularity, software conversion
to an INTERNET interactive database and incorporation of a GIS component
for data presentation (something like the new CIESIN ddviewer).</p>
<p>Data Distribution License: For more than a year, the Archive is an
authorized distributor of microdatafrom the Israeli Bureau of
Statistics, both to the academic and to other sectors. This license has
considerably improved the Archive s public position as well as its
budgetary basis. Speaking about the Bureau of Statistics, the Archive is
negotiating now, on behalf of the academic users, on the dissemination
of the 1995 census microdata and its format. However, the raising public
sensibility regarding confidentiality issues means that we are going to
receive further grouping of variables for larger geographic units,
compared with the 1983 (the previous) census microdata.</p>
<p>WWW home page: The <a href="http://www3.huji.ac.il/www_magar/il-home.htm">SSDA
homepage</a> includes,
besides general information, also news about recent holdings, data
request forms and a TELNET interface for searching the online catalog.</p>
<p><strong>UK</strong></p>
<p><strong>Five New National Data Centres</strong></p>
<p>The Joint Information Services Committee (JISC) of the Higher Education
Funding Councils for England and Wales and Scotland have provided
funding during the year for a number of initiatives of interest to
IASSIST members. These include the designation and funding of five
national data centres:</p>
<ul>
<li>The University of Bath ( providers of the BIDS bibliographic
citation services, etc.)</li>
<li>The University of Edinburgh (the Data Library, host to a variety of
data services )</li>
<li>The University of Essex (the Data Archive)</li>
<li>The University of Manchester (host to the CURL bibliographic
databases and the MIDAS service)</li>
<li>King&rsquo;s College London, host the the Executive of the new Arts and
Humanities Data Service.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Arts and Humanities Data Service</strong></p>
<p>The Arts and Humanities Data Service has designated three centres so far
under its umbrella. These are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The History Data Service at the Data Archive, University of Essex</li>
<li>The Oxford Text Archive</li>
<li>The Archaeology Data Service at the University of York.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ESRC Data Programmes</strong></p>
<p>The Economic and Social Research Council has continued to support a
large number of initiatives and programmes of value to our community.
These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>ALCD (Analysis of Large and Complex Datasets) for which a call for
bids for the second phase has just gone out</li>
<li>SOSIG, the Social Sciences Information Gateway</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>News from the Data Archive</strong></p>
<p>In addition to the programmes and inititiative described above, the Data
Archive at the University of Essex has received the following specific
project funding from JISC:</p>
<ul>
<li>to carry out a programme of digitisation of paper documentation and
to upgrade the Archive&rsquo;s preservation systems.</li>
<li>to improve access to the Archive&rsquo;s considerable collection of
opinion polls. The funding will allow the Archive to fill in gaps in
the collection, undertake data processing and re-structuring, key in
the full texts of questionnaires, provide indexing and information
retrieval linked to BIRON and to design a data access system.</li>
<li>to explore the data needs of psychologists. The project is a joint
one with the Department of Psychology at Cardiff and the Centre for
Teaching Initiatives in Psychology in York. The project arose
because of a concern that although the Archive covers social science
data the holdings are of limited interest to experimental
psychologists. However the extension of this area is not
straightforward and the project will be mainly exploratory.
