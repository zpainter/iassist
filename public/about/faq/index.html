<h3 id="faq2">What is the IASSIST membership year?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>July 1 - June 30</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="faq3">What happens if I join before March 1 of a particular year?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Your membership goes to the end of that membership year. For
example, if you join in Feb 2009, your membership ends June
30, 2009.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="faq4">What happens if I join on or after March 1st of a particular year?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Your membership extends to the end of the NEXT membership year. For
example, if you join in March 2009, your membership ends June
30 2010.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="faq5">What happens if I join at the conference/when registering for the conference?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Your membership always goes to the end of the next membership year.
For example, if you join at the conference in May 2009, your
membership ends June 30 2010.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="faq6">How do I renew my membership?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A general e-mail announcement with a form will be sent out in April
for the next membership year. Payment for the upcoming membership
year can be made using that form or in conjunction with your
conference registration.An e-mail renewal form is also sent in July
to those who have not renewed with their conference registration or
by separate submission. A second notice is sent out later in the
year if we have no record of your renewal. Questions about your
membership status should be directed to the
<a href="https://www.iassistdata.info/treasurers/">Treasurer</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="faq15">What currencies can I use to pay my membership fees?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Membership fees paid with your conference registration are in
whatever currency is used by the conference. The rate is provided by
the Treasurer. Payments can be made in US dollars, Canadian dollars,
GB Pounds, or Euros. When you pay by credit card paying in US Dollars is usually the easiest option. If you need to pay by check/cheque &ndash;
please contact the <a href="https://www.iassistdata.info/treasurers/">currency-appropriate
treasurer</a>. You need to
designate the currency in which you want your payment processed. If
no designation is made we will base it on your home country whenever
possible.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="faq16">How do you determine the non-US dollar membership fees?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The Treasurer makes yearly evaluations of the Canadian, GB Pound,
and Euro rates. We generally look at a month or more of rates (to
account for slight fluctuations) and then take the current rate for
$50 US and round to the nearest full Canadian Dollar, Pound, or
Euro. These rates are set in February of each year and are not
adjusted unless there are major changes in the exchange rate.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="faq17">Where do I send my membership payment?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Please refer to the <a href="https://www.iassistdata.info/howtopay">Payment Information</a>. Credit card transactions in US Dollars will be conducted automatically, via PayPal. Canadian members send their cheque payments to the Canadian Assistant Treasurer. Members in the US, Africa, Asia/Pacific regions and residents of Latin America may send payments to the US Treasurer. Members in the Europe may send payments to the European Assistant Treasurer. Contact information for all Treasurers is at     <a href="http://www.iassistdata.info/treasurers">www.iassistdata.info/treasurers</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="faq13">May I buy a digital copy of the IASSIST list of members?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>No. As a non-profit organization, the resources of IASSIST,
including its discussion list, are not to be used for commercial
purposes including advertising or other promotional efforts related
to commercial products. IASSIST Policy does permit, however, the use
of its discussion list for announcements of the availability of new
datasets from members&rsquo; institutions and conferences for other
organizations. IASSIST Policy does not permit the use of this
service by, or for, non-members.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="faq7">If I give a workshop at an IASSIST conference, do I pay conference fees to attend the full conference?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="faq9">How does IASSIST choose where to hold its annual conferences?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The IASSIST Conference is held annually and is hosted by IASSIST
members, often drawing upon some level of organizational support
from their institutions. Guidelines have been prepared by the
IASSIST Administrative Committee to assist those who might consider
hosting an IASSIST Conference. See these <a href="/conferences/hosting-guidelines">guidelines for hosting a
conference</a>.
Proposals to host the annual conference are submitted to the current
IASSIST President in time to be considered by the Administrative
Meeting preferably two years before the conference for which the
application is being made. Proposals are accepted by a vote by the
Administrative Committee at its meeting.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="faq1">How can I become involved in the IASSIST activities?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Besides attending the annual conference, small groups of volunteers
work together during the year on designated activities. These groups
can be:
&ndash;Committees (permanent groups with a mission designated in the
constitution),
&ndash;Action Groups (groups formed by the Administrative Committee for
a defined, limited-time task),
&ndash;Interest Groups (groups formed by the Administrative Committee to
serve as a forum for discussion on topics of interest).
See the <a href="/about/committees-and-groups">Committees page</a> for the names and
charges of these groups with contact information for each Chair.
With the exception of the Elections Committee, volunteers are
welcome to join at any time and can do so by contacting the Chair.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="faq8">What if I want to take on a leadership role in IASSIST?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The executive body of IASSIST is the Administrative Committee. It is
comprised of elected officials (regional representatives, regional
secretaries, tresurer, secretary, president, vice-president), the
immediate past-president, and the following appointed officials: web
editor, IQ editor and archivist. Elections are held once every two
years and nomination calls are open to all members. Appointed
positions are made by the President and approved by the
Administrative Committee so persons should make their interest known
when vacancies are announced. A <a href="/about/officials">list of current officials</a> is
available at the website. Contact anyone on this list if you want more information.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="faq14">How are Regional Secretaries chosen and what do they do?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>One Regional Secretary is elected for each
<a href="/about/regional-secretaries-and-reports/">Region</a>. They are
elected by members of their region for a two-year term and may be
re-elected. Regional Secretaries, the primary officers of IASSIST in
their respective regions, provide leadership and guidance in the
realization of IASSIST&rsquo;s objectives in their respective regions.
They represent IASSIST in its dealings with external bodies and
agencies, particularly at the national level. Regional Secretaries
form part of the Membership Committee and attend all meetings of the
General Assembly and the Administrative Committee. They submit a
yearly report to the Administrative Committee and the Annual General
Assembly on activities in their region relating to social science
data. This report is posted on the IASSIST website so that it is
available to all members.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="faq19">Can I propose a new Action Group or Interest Group?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>A minimum of three (3) members of IASSIST may make application to
the Administrative Committee for the establishment of an Action
Group, minimum of five (5) members for the establishment of an
Interest Group. <a href="/about/all-about-interest-groups">More information about interest
groups</a>
is available on the website.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="faq20">What if I can&rsquo;t wait for the annual meeting and want to form an Action Group or Interest Group to deal with an important issue or topic of the moment?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>If the establishment of an Action/Interest Group is made during the
course of the fiscal year, the Administrative Committee shall
determine the duration of the term at the time of establishment.
After receiving the proposal the Executive may then forward that
proposal, with or without comment or amendment, to the
Administrative Committee for endorsement. It will be subject to the
same conditions and restrictions as any Action/Interest Group, as
described in <a href="/about/iassist-constitution">IASSIST Constitution</a>
(ARTICLE XII - BY-LAWS).</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="faq10">Can I nominate someone for an IASSIST Achievement Award?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes. An award committee, consisting of the three immediate past
presidents of the association, administers the <a href="/about/iassist-achievement-award">IASSIST Achievement
Award</a>. Any member of
the association, including a member of the award committee, may
nominate an individual to be recipient of the IASSIST Achievement
Award. The award will not be given for a single significant
accomplishment, but will be awarded for a sustained contribution to
the organization and the profession.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="faq11">How do I access the IASSIST list serv?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><a href="/about/iassist-discussion-list/">discuss@lists.iassistdata.org</a> is an email discussion list for IASSIST members. Everyone with a current membership and for whom we have an email address, and an indication that you wish to join the list, is registered on this distribution list. To modify your subscription use the links that are on the IASSIST <a href="http://www.iassistdata.info/directory">Membership Directory</a> (requires login), to which all active members have access.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="faq12">Is the IASSIST listserv available to browse and search?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>See <a href="/about/iassist-discussion-list/">discuss@lists.iassistdata.org</a> about how members can see previous postings to the list by using the link to
the list archive that is on the IASSIST <a href="http://www.iassistdata.info/">Membership
Site</a>.  Message posted August 2007 to date can be browsed by date.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="faq23">What is the scope of the IASSIST Quarterly (IQ)?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The IASSIST Quarterly is the long-running open access journal of our
organisation. The Editor is appointed by the Administrative
Committee, and is supported by the chair and members of the
Publications committee. For more information <a href="https://www.iassistquarterly.com/index.php/iassist/about">view the IQ
page.</a></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="faq24">How do I submit an article to the IQ?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Articles are welcome throughout the year. See <a href="https://iassistquarterly.com/index.php/iassist/information/authors">instructions for
authors</a> in the IASSIST Quarterly journal.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="faq22">How is the IASSIST website and iBlog managed?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The IASSIST Web Editor is appointed by the Administrative Committee.
The Communications Committee supports the Web Editor by volunteering
to be active on the <a href="/about/web-team">Web Team</a>.
The iBlog is open for any members to post items of interest to the
community, subject to editorial control by the web team. The Web
Editor ensures there is a regular stream of content on the blog.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="faq25">How can I follow / be followed by iassistdata on Twitter or Facebook?</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>IASSIST has a Twitter account, managed by the web team. If you have
a twitter account, you can follow iassistdata. We&rsquo;ll follow you
back unless you block us (it&rsquo;s up to you!). We&rsquo;ll occasionally
retweet data-related tweets. A recent stream comes through the
IASSIST home page. View an <a href="/blog/iassist-twitter-account">iBlog
post</a> announcing the IASSIST twitter
account. Our Facebook gets roughly the same status updates as the
Twitter account.</p>
