Québec, Canada</p>
<h3 id="1-welcome-e-boyko-president">1. Welcome E Boyko, President</h3>
<p>The meeting was called to order at 12:59 with about 190 persons present.</p>
<p>E Boyko expressed thanks to the Local Arrangements Committee, ledt by
Anastassia Khouri and Susan Czarnocki, and the Program Committee, led by
Suzette Giles and Louise Corti.</p>
<p>He explained that in addition to its constitutional functions, the
annual general meeting provides an overview of what the association
does, and encouraged newcomers to get involved in its activities.</p>
<h3 id="2-approval-of-the-minutes-of-the-2006-annual-general-meeting">2. Approval of the minutes of the 2006 Annual General Meeting</h3>

<p>President &amp; Vice-president - E Boyko &amp; M Wright</p>
<p>E Boyko reported that he has intervened very little in the actual
running of the association, but has mainly spent his energies on
representing the interests of it. M. Wright noted a forthcoming call for
proposals for funding of projects that further the objectives of the
IASSIST Strategic Plan. Allocated funds in 2006-2007 sent two IASSIST
members to the CODATA conference in Beijing.</p>
<p>Treasurer - J Green</p>
<p>J Green thanked the assistant treasurers R Boily and S Macdonald. The
association has three sets of accounts in three countries. A
diagrammatic overview of the distribution of the funds was presented.
The association has 3 times the annual operating budget in the bank, and
is in a healthy financial position. As well, the association has some
long term investments. Last year&rsquo;s expenditures were over budget. A
large portion of association revenues are from membership fees; these
fees are returned to the membership in the form of for example the
IASSIST Quarterly and the listserv. The budget for the coming year is
balanced.</p>

Data Network (NADA) has been formed out of the Australian Statistical
Office. New Zealand is organizing a new data archive, in Auckland. The

<p>The Data Liberation Initiative (DLI) is another year older, and has been
focusing on training programs. The full report for the region will be

collaborative projects, especially DDI projects, in Canada, some in the
form of partnerships between Statistics Canada and academia, especially
to do with standards and best practices.</p>
<p>Members were also encouraged to try out the membership database.</p>
<p>Europe - M Kleemola</p>
<p>Reported briefly on highlights: lots of projects and organizational
changes - some connections to IASSIST, via ESS and CESSDA. The European
Social Survey (ESS) data will be available this autumn. The full report
will be made available on the web.</p>

Seid. The association is looking forward to increased activity in
Africa.</p>

committee is directed by KB Rasmussen, R Rice, and S Cannon.</p>
<p>KB Rasmussen - publication of the IQ is one year behind, but that&rsquo;s
good, because we have been even farther behind. All presenters were
urged to submit their presentations.</p>

coordinator role. Highlights of the past year: membership section up to
date, posting minutes and new officers, revised flyer. New FAQ for

membership database to harvest member institutions web sites. Wants more
